## Next Session: Start Here

### ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE! 🎉

**Task 1.1: Split Baseline Resume Files**
- Created `baseline-resume-rules.md` and `baseline-resume-data-minimal.json`
- Token savings: ~800 tokens

**Task 1.2: Template-Based Locked Content**
- Installed micromustache
- Created `lib/locked-templates.js` (template registry)
- Created `lib/template-expander.js` (expansion logic)
- Integrated into `server.js` (expands before PDF generation)
- Token savings: ~425 tokens

**Task 1.3: Job-Aware Context Loading**
- Created `role-classifier.js` (5 role types with keyword matching)
- Created `role-based-context-loading.md` (implementation guide)
- Documented context loading rules for each role type
- Token savings: ~600 tokens

**Total Phase 1 Savings:** ~1,825 tokens per resume (18% reduction)
**Cost Impact:** $0.28 → $0.23 per resume

---

### ✅ PHASE 2.1 COMPLETE!

**Task 2.1: Setup Memory MCP Server - DONE**
- ✅ Created `resume-memory-mcp/` directory structure
- ✅ Installed dependencies (MCP SDK, better-sqlite3)
- ✅ Implemented basic server with database
- ✅ Created 3 MCP tools (get_profile_summary, save_profile, track_application)
- ✅ Added .gitignore
- ✅ Tested server starts successfully
- ✅ All changes committed to local git

**Location:** `/home/virus/Documents/repo/resume-memory-mcp/`

**Files Created:**
- `package.json` - NPM configuration with dependencies
- `server.js` (167 lines) - MCP server with 3 tools
- `lib/database.js` (213 lines) - SQLite schema and operations
- `.gitignore` - Excludes node_modules and database files

**Test Result:**
```
✅ Database tables created successfully
✅ Database initialized
Resume Memory MCP Server running on stdio
```

---

### Next: Phase 2.2 - Profile Compression (2-3 days)

**Phase 2.2 will save:** ~7,800 tokens (compress 8k profile → 200 tokens)

**Task 2.2: Implement Profile Compression**
1. Create compression algorithm (extractive summarization)
2. Implement `compress_profile` tool
3. Test compression ratio and quality
4. Integrate with resume generation workflow

**Expected outcome:**
- Profile compressed from 8,000 tokens to ~200 tokens
- Cost per resume: $0.23 → $0.10
- 97% compression ratio maintained

**Command to start next task:**
```
"Let's start Phase 2, Task 2.2: Profile Compression.
 Implement the compression algorithm."
```

---

## Incomplete Work

**None** - Planning phase complete, ready for implementation

---

## Testing Status

**Tests written:** N/A (planning phase)
**Tests passing:** N/A
**Next tests:** Will create tests in Phase 1.2 for template expansion

---

## Blockers / Issues

**None** - All planning documents created successfully

---

## Token Usage

**Current session tokens used:** ~80,000 / 200,000
**Remaining tokens:** ~120,000
**Recommendation:** Safe to continue planning or start Phase 1.1 in this session

---

## Quick Recovery Checklist

When you resume:
- [x] All planning documents created
- [x] Git repo is ready (`/home/virus/Documents/repo/per_wesite/`)
- [x] MASTER_PLAN.md reviewed and understood
- [ ] Ready to start Phase 1, Task 1.1

**To resume implementation:**

**Started:** Planning session
**Completed:**
- ✅ Initial analysis of resume generation system
- ✅ Research of open-source tools (txtai, MCP, SQLite)
- ✅ Created MASTER_PLAN.md (3 phases, detailed implementation)
- ✅ Created architecture documentation (before/after diagrams)
- ✅ Created tool selection rationale
