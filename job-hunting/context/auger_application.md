# Auger - Principal/Staff Software Engineer Application

## Top Reasons for Interest in Joining Auger

Honestly, three things stand out.

First, the problem itself. I spent the last few years at Freefly debugging crashed drones - usually under time pressure because a film production or infrastructure inspection was waiting on us to get their equipment back in the air. What I learned is that when critical systems go down, it's never just a technical problem. Productions lose money, inspections get delayed, and people's livelihoods are affected. Reading about Auger's view that "supply chain problems are human problems" hit home because I've lived that on a smaller scale. The idea of building systems that prevent those downstream impacts at a global level - making sure products actually get to shelves, reducing worker burnout - that's meaningful work.

Second, the technical challenge lines up really well with what I've been building. At Grid CoOperator, I built GridCOP - an AI agent that helps power grid analysts query databases in natural language instead of writing complex SQL. We saw about 70% faster research times because analysts could just ask questions instead of wrestling with queries. That experience taught me a lot about making AI systems work reliably in production, not just in demos. Auger's vision of replacing "franken-software" and complex spreadsheets with something intuitive sounds like the same problem, just at a much bigger scale. The technical stack you're describing - distributed systems with AI agents that can reason and act autonomously - is exactly where I want to push my skills next.

Third, the team and timing. Dave Clark's background is pretty rare - someone who's actually operated supply chains at Amazon scale, now building from scratch with proper funding and startup speed. I've worked at a few robotics startups where we moved fast but also had to learn expensive lessons the hard way. Having someone who's already learned those lessons, combined with the resources to build properly, seems like the right environment to do really ambitious work without the usual startup chaos.

I'm at a point where I want to work on something that matters, with people who know what they're doing, on problems that are genuinely hard to solve. Auger checks all three boxes.
