Each asset type presents distinct operational challenges: bridges require close-proximity maneuvering around complex steel structures with precise positioning for crack detection, while power lines demand safe distance protocols and specialized thermal payloads to identify hotspots without risking electrical interference. Pipeline inspections need rapid area coverage with OGI sensors for leak detection and terrain-following capabilities, whereas wind turbines require platforms that can handle turbulent air conditions and maintain stable sensor positioning during blade-by-blade analysis at significant heights.
