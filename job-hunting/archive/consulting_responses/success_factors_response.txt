Working across different asset types, success comes down to payload matching—thermal for electrical hotspots and pipeline leaks, high-res RGB for structural cracks, and LiDAR for 3D mapping—while understanding environmental demands like wind conditions for turbines or collision resistance for confined spaces. The biggest differentiator is thorough pre-flight planning that accounts for regulatory requirements, weather windows, and having backup configurations when field conditions don't match expectations.
