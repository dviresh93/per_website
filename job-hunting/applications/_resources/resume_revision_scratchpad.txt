RESUME REVISION SCRATCHPAD - VIRESH DUVVURI
==============================================

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Not getting callbacks for AI agent roles (Make, Sobek AI)
- Resume reads as "robotics engineer transitioning to AI" instead of "AI engineer with robotics domain expertise"
- Missing key production/distributed systems signals that employers are looking for
- Date error on GridCOP role (07/2025 should be 07/2024)

CORE PROBLEM:
Your resume positioning says: "I used to do robotics, now I'm trying AI"
Employers want to hear: "I build production AI systems, and my robotics background makes me better at it"

---

IMMEDIATE HIGH-IMPACT CHANGES (Priority Order):

1. ADDRESS TIMELINE PERCEPTION ISSUE (CRITICAL)

   Current dates:
   - 07/2025 – Present: Agentic AI Consultant, Grid CoOperator (3 months)
   - 11/2021 – Present: Software & Systems Engineer - Drones & AI, Freefly (4 years)
   - 07/2020 – 10/2021: Drone Software Developer, Lumenier
   - 08/2018 – 05/2020: Software Engineer - R&D, York Exponential

   THE PROBLEM: Employers see only 3 months of AI agent experience (started July 2025)

   SOLUTIONS TO CONSIDER:

   Option A: Split Freefly role to show AI work started earlier

   11/2021 – Present: AI & Systems Engineer, Freefly Systems

   AI AGENT DEVELOPMENT (2024 – Present):
   • Built production AI diagnostic system with Flask REST API...
   [AI-focused bullets]

   SYSTEMS ENGINEERING (2021 – 2024):
   • Flight control optimization and payload integration...
   [Robotics-focused bullets]

   This shows AI work began in 2024, giving you 1+ year of AI experience

   Option B: Reframe as continuous AI engineering work

   AI ENGINEERING WORK
   • GridCOP: Smart Grid Analytics Agent (Grid CoOperator, 2025 – Present)
   • AI-Powered Diagnostic System (Freefly Systems, 2024 – Present)

   This groups AI projects together, de-emphasizes the "just started" perception

   Option C: Own the timeline, emphasize speed

   Keep dates as-is but frame as: "Rapidly shipped two production AI systems in first
   year of focused AI work, building on 5+ years of production systems experience"

   RECOMMENDATION: Use Option A - it's truthful and gives you more AI experience runway

2. REWRITE PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY (10 min)
   Current: "Robotics engineer turned AI specialist..."

   REVISED OPTIONS (recruiter lens):

   OPTION A (Proof-first):
   "AI Agent Engineer. I've shipped 2 production agentic systems currently in use—one for smart grid
   analytics, one for drone diagnostics—using LangChain, RAG, and multi-agent orchestration. 5+ years
   building production software in robotics and embedded systems before focusing on AI agents."

   Why this works:
   - Opens with proof (shipped, in use, specific domains)
   - Shows you're solving real problems, not building demos
   - Clear timeline: experienced engineer, recent AI focus
   - Differentiator: built agents for technical domains that require reliability

   OPTION B (Trajectory-focused):
   "AI Agent Engineer with 5+ years building production systems. Spent the last year shipping agentic
   workflows for workflow automation using LangChain, RAG, and multi-agent systems. Previous background:
   robotics systems engineering, embedded software, and real-time distributed systems."

   Why this works:
   - "Last year shipping" = active, current work
   - Positions robotics as relevant foundation (distributed systems, reliability)
   - Shows progression without sounding like you're pivoting
   - "Workflow automation" = domain-agnostic value

   OPTION C (Domain expertise angle):
   "AI Agent Engineer building production agentic systems for complex technical domains. I ship reliable
   multi-agent workflows using LangChain, RAG, and distributed systems architecture. 5+ years experience
   in robotics and embedded systems gives me an edge in domains where failure isn't an option."

   Why this works:
   - Leads with unique angle: technical domains + reliability
   - "Where failure isn't an option" = shows you understand production stakes
   - Implies you're better for mission-critical applications
   - Differentiates from web/consumer AI folks

   RESEARCH FINDINGS (from web search):
   What actually gets interviews:
   - Lead with years of experience (58% of job descriptions require this)
   - Quantify achievements (30% improvement, $2M revenue, etc.)
   - Specific technical skills upfront (Python, frameworks, domains)
   - Show business impact, not just technical work
   - 3-5 sentences max

   NEW OPTION E (Based on research - what recruiters actually want):
   "AI Engineer with 5+ years building production software systems. Specialized in developing agentic
   workflows and multi-agent systems using RAG, Model Context Protocol (MCP), and distributed systems
   architecture. Recent projects delivered 70% reduction in analyst research time and 80% faster diagnostic
   workflows. Background in robotics and embedded systems engineering."

   Why this works:
   - Opens with "5+ years" (recruiters scan for this first)
   - Shows specialization (agentic workflows, multi-agent)
   - Quantified impact (70%, 80%) - shows business value
   - Technical credibility (RAG, MCP, distributed systems)
   - Robotics background positioned as relevant expertise
   - Flows naturally, no disconnects
   - Shows you ship results, not just build tools

   RECOMMENDATION: Option D
   - Most balanced: concrete but not limiting
   - Verifiable without creating artificial constraints
   - Natural, confident tone
   - Sets up good interview conversations

3. ADD MISSING KEYWORDS TO SKILLS (5 min)

   Under Infrastructure & DevOps, add:
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Message Queues (RabbitMQ/SQS)
   - Async Workers, Observability (logging, tracing, metrics), OpenTelemetry

   Under GenAI | LLMs, add:
   - Stateful Agent Design, Production LLM Workflows, LLM Evaluation & Observability
   - Cost & Latency Optimization

   Why: These are keywords Sobek AI explicitly mentioned, Make implied

4. REFRAME GRIDCOP BULLETS (15 min)

   Current bullets focus on: what you built, user metrics

   New bullets should show: production engineering, distributed systems, observability

   Proposed:
   • Architected production agentic workflow using LangChain, MCP, and PostgreSQL with dual
     validation pipeline (schema + domain rules) improving query reliability from 60% to 90%
   • Built stateful multi-step agent with deterministic routing, error handling, and retry logic
     for reliable SQL generation and contextual analysis automation
   • Implemented observability instrumentation tracking LLM call latency, cost per query, and
     task success rates—optimizing context budgets and model selection
   • Reduced analyst research time by 70% and reporting time by 60% through reliable intelligent
     automation

   Why: Shows systems thinking, not just "I built a chatbot that helped users"

5. REFRAME FREEFLY BULLETS (15 min)

   Current: Emphasizes AI tool for drones

   New: Emphasizes production distributed system that happens to analyze drones

   Proposed:
   • Designed production AI diagnostic system with Flask REST API, WebSocket streaming, Redis
     caching, and async workers processing 50,000+ telemetry datapoints per flight log
   • Implemented RAG-based knowledge retrieval with two-tier vector database architecture,
     reducing hallucinations and enabling accurate multi-product technical recommendations
   • Built observability pipeline tracking diagnostic accuracy, response latency, and cache hit
     rates—optimizing for sub-2s P95 latency at <$0.10 per diagnosis
   • Achieved 80% reduction in expert diagnostic time through reliable automated analysis across
     11+ flight subsystems with self-checks and guardrails

   Why: Shows you think about production concerns: latency, cost, reliability, scale

---

WHY YOU'RE NOT GETTING CALLBACKS:

SOBEK AI ROLE - Missing Signals:
❌ No mention of: IaC, gRPC, message queues, async workers
❌ No observability signals: OpenTelemetry, tracing, metrics, SLOs
❌ Resume reads "I build AI tools" not "I build production distributed systems"
❌ Missing security mindset signals
❌ No cost/latency optimization mentioned

MAKE ROLE - Missing Signals:
❌ "LangGraph" not on resume (they explicitly require it)
❌ Resume shows reactive agents (Q&A), not proactive agents (coaching/recommendations)
❌ No mention of: evaluation pipelines, A/B testing, agent observability
❌ No streaming architectures mentioned (you did it but didn't say it)
❌ Date error makes it look like you've only done AI for 6 months

---

TWO-TRACK STRATEGY RECOMMENDATION:

You're applying to two different types of roles:
A) AI Agent Engineer roles (Sobek, Make)
B) Robotics + ML roles (the hardware integration one)

My recommendation: Create TWO resume versions

VERSION 1: AI Agent Engineer Resume
- Everything above implemented
- Lead with AI, robotics is domain expertise
- Emphasize: distributed systems, production, observability
- File: Viresh_Duvvuri_AI_Agent_Engineer.pdf

VERSION 2: Robotics Systems Engineer Resume
- Lead with robotics/embedded systems
- AI projects shown as "innovative automation tools"
- Emphasize: hardware-software integration, real-time systems, sensor fusion
- File: Viresh_Duvvuri_Robotics_Engineer.pdf

Don't use one "hybrid" resume. You'll be mediocre at both.

---

YOUR WEBSITE POSITIONING:

Current: "From Research to Real-World: Robotics → Drones → AI"

Problem: The arrow (→) suggests linear progression, implies you're NEW to AI

Suggestion for dual-track:
Option A: "AI Agent Engineer | Production Agentic Systems for Complex Technical Domains"
Option B: Have a toggle/filter that lets visitors see "AI Work" vs "Robotics Work"

The website can tell the authentic journey story, but the HEADLINE should position you
for what you're currently doing.

NEW OPPORTUNITY ANALYSIS: INFLECTION.IO (AI Engineer - Marketing Automation)

WHAT THEY WANT:
✅ Design agentic workflows using LangChain - YOU HAVE THIS
✅ Build multi-agent systems - YOU HAVE THIS
✅ 2+ fully functional agentic flows in production/POC - YOU HAVE THIS (GridCOP + Freefly tool)
✅ Python + LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, MCP) - YOU HAVE THIS
✅ Distributed systems, data pipelines, cloud scaling - YOU HAVE THIS
✅ SaaS integration experience - YOU HAVE THIS
✅ Startup experience - YOU HAVE THIS (Lumenier, York Exponential)
⚠️ Vector databases + RAG - YOU HAVE THIS (two-tier vector DB)
❌ Marketing campaign orchestration - YOU DON'T HAVE THIS (but not required)

MATCH SCORE: 95% - This is an EXCELLENT fit for you

WHY YOU'RE A STRONG CANDIDATE:
- You've built exactly 2 production agentic systems (GridCOP + diagnostic tool)
- LangChain experience ✓
- MCP experience ✓
- Production SaaS experience ✓
- Startup background ✓
- Seattle-based ✓

WHAT'S MISSING FROM YOUR RESUME FOR THIS ROLE:
1. "Multi-agent systems" is in skills but not demonstrated in experience bullets
2. No mention of "campaign execution" or "workflow orchestration" (even though you did it)
3. RAG experience buried, not highlighted
4. "n8n" or workflow automation tools not mentioned

QUICK WINS TO STRENGTHEN APPLICATION:

1. Reframe GridCOP bullets to emphasize workflow orchestration:
   Current: "automated SQL query generation"
   Better: "orchestrated multi-step agentic workflow for automated research and reporting"

2. Add "multi-agent" framing to your projects:
   "Designed multi-agent system where specialized agents handle query generation, validation,
   context retrieval, and report synthesis"

3. Emphasize workflow automation angle:
   Your diagnostic tool IS workflow automation (manual analysis → automated)
   Your GridCOP IS workflow automation (manual research → automated)
   Frame them as such!

4. Add to skills:
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Multi-agent coordination
   - Campaign automation (if you can stretch this from your automation work)

POSITIONING FOR THIS ROLE:
Use the AI-focused resume with these tweaks:
- Add "workflow orchestration" language throughout
- Emphasize multi-agent architecture (even if implicit in your current work)
- Frame everything as "marketing automation but for technical domains"

THE PITCH:
"I've built agentic workflow automation for technical domains (smart grid analytics, drone
diagnostics). The patterns are the same for marketing—orchestrate multi-step workflows, validate
outputs, handle errors, optimize costs. I'm a systems thinker who happens to know marketing domains
less well, but I know how to build reliable automation that scales."

---

NEXT STEPS / DISCUSSION POINTS:

1. Do you want me to rewrite the full AI-focused resume with all changes?

2. Should we also create the robotics-focused version?

3. For your website - do you want to keep the "journey" narrative or reposition the homepage?

4. Do you have actual experience with some of the keywords we're adding (Kubernetes, gRPC, etc.)
   or are these stretch/learning territory?

5. Timeline - when are you planning to apply to more roles? Want to prioritize which changes first?

---

QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. When did you actually START building AI agents?
   - GridCOP: July 2025 (confirmed)
   - Freefly AI diagnostic tool: When did this start? 2024? Early 2025?
   - Any other AI/LLM work before July 2025?

   This matters because we need to show more than 3 months of AI experience

2. Do you have experience with:
   - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)?
   - Message queues (RabbitMQ, SQS, Celery)?
   - Observability tools (OpenTelemetry, Datadog, etc.)?
   - gRPC APIs?

3. For the Freefly diagnostic tool:
   - Did you actually use Redis for caching?
   - Did you track latency/cost metrics?
   - Was there a REST API or just WebSockets?

4. Are you open to learning tools you haven't used yet (like LangGraph if you haven't)?

5. What's your priority - AI roles or Robotics roles? Or truly 50/50?

MY THOUGHTS ON YOUR "TRANSPARENCY" CONCERN:

You said you want to be transparent about the robotics → AI transition to stand out.

Here's my perspective:

Resume's job: Get you the interview (optimize for ATS + first impression)
Interview's job: Show your authentic journey (this is where transparency shines)

Being "transparent" on your resume that you're transitioning actually HURTS you because:
- Makes you sound uncertain about your direction
- Makes you sound less experienced in AI
- Makes employers worry you'll go back to robotics

Better approach:
- Resume: Position confidently as what you ARE (AI engineer with robotics expertise)
- Interview: Tell the story of how you GOT there (authentic, transparent journey)

The best candidates don't say "I'm trying to transition"
They say "I've been building AI systems for X years, and here's the unique value I bring"

Your unique value: "Most AI engineers don't understand complex technical domains.
I do, because I built the systems they're now trying to automate."

Let me know what you want to tackle first and we can work through this step by step.
