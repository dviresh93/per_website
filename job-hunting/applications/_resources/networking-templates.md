# Networking & Communication Templates

Human-sounding templates for LinkedIn messages, connection requests, follow-ups, and application questions.

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

**Be human, not a template:**
- Keep it short (3-5 sentences max)
- Be specific (mention something about them or the role)
- Sound conversational, not formal
- Show genuine interest
- No buzzwords or corporate speak

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "I'm reaching out to..." (too formal)
- ❌ "I'm excited to connect..." (overused)
- ❌ Long paragraphs
- ❌ Generic copy-paste messages
- ❌ Asking for favors in first message
