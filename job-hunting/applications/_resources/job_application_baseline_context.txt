   - Interactive AI chat interface for flight data insights
   - Transformed expert analysis from hours to minutes
   - 80% reduction in manual log review workflows

2. GridCOP: Smart Grid Analytics Agent (Grid CoOperator):
   - Agentic AI system using LangChain, MCP, Python, SQL databases
   - Intelligent SQL database querying with dual validation system
   - Context-aware response generation for utility data analysis
   - Reduced analyst research time by 70%
   - Enhanced analyst productivity through automated research workflows

3. Advanced Flight Control Systems (Lumenier):
   - Custom PX4 flight modes including Toss-to-Launch and room surveillance
   - GPS-denied navigation using LiDAR sensors and optical flow
   - 360° obstacle avoidance and position hold
   - MAVLink and UAVCAN protocol implementation

4. Human Machine Interface for Collaborative Welding (York Exponential):
   - Built using Python, Kivy framework, and ROS2
   - Universal Robot integration with simplified programming interface
   - Reduced operator programming complexity by 50%
   - Platform-independent control system

TECHNICAL SKILLS:
- Programming: Python, C++, React, Docker, Git, SQL, Android, OOP, Multithreading, WebSockets
- GenAI/LLMs: LangChain, LangGraph, MCP, RAG, Multi-Agent Systems, Prompt Engineering, Context Management, Agent Orchestration, VectorDB, LLMops
- Robotics/Embedded: PX4, Ardupilot, MAVLink, MAVSDK, PyMAVLink, UAVCAN, RTOS, I2C, UART, SPI, CAN
- Cloud/Platforms: AWS, Linux (bash scripting), Windows (bat files)

CORE STRENGTHS:
- Understanding both engineering problems and how to build AI systems that solve them in production
- Experience building fault-tolerant robotics systems translates to AI agent architecture
- Consistently turning manual bottlenecks into automated AI workflows
- Full-stack development from embedded systems to user-facing applications
- Domain expertise across aerospace, robotics, smart grid operations
- Track record of 50-80% workflow improvements through automation

UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION:
- Robotics engineer turned AI specialist with deep domain knowledge
- Understands both the engineering problems that need solving AND how to build AI systems that actually work in production
- Experience spans embedded systems, flight control, sensor integration, and modern AI/ML frameworks
- Proven ability to identify bottlenecks and build AI solutions that deliver measurable results

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:
- Agentic AI Consultant, Grid CoOperator (07/2025 – Present)
