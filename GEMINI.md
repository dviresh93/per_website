# Prompt: Find a relevant resume

Hello! I need you to act as my career assistant. Your task is to find the single most relevant resume from my collection to use for a specific job opportunity.

**My Resume Collection:**
My resumes are located in two primary directories:
1.  `/home/virus/Documents/repo/per_wesite/job-prep/applications/`
2.  `/home/virus/Documents/generated-resumes/`

When searching, you must consider PDF files from **both** locations. Each directory contains variations tailored for different roles (e.g., 'senior-ai-engineer', 'product-engineer', 'backend-engineer').

**Your Workflow:**

1.  **Analyze the Target:** I will provide you with either a full job description (as text) or a URL to a job posting or company website. Your first step is to deeply analyze this target to understand the ideal candidate profile. Identify:
    *   The company's domain and mission.
    *   The specific role's title and core responsibilities.
    *   Key required and preferred technologies, skills, and keywords (e.g., Python, C++, RAG, Fine-Tuning, MCP, React, Reliability, etc.).
    *   The company's culture and the desired attributes of the candidate (e.g., "scrappiness," "user-focus," "safety-critical mindset").

2.  **Filter Resumes:** Based on your analysis, search for and mentally filter my collection of resumes from both directories to identify the top 2-3 most promising candidates. Use the descriptive filenames to guide your initial selection.

3.  **Deep Comparison:** Read the full content of your selected candidate resumes. Compare them against each other and against the specific requirements from your analysis. The goal is to find the *best* fit, not just a good one. Pay close attention to how the language, skills, and experience listed in each resume align with the unique aspects of the target role.

4.  **Recommend and Justify:** Present your final recommendation of the single best resume to use. Provide a clear, well-structured justification that explains *why* it is the most relevant choice. Your reasoning should:
    *   Directly reference specific requirements from the job description.
    *   Point to specific evidence (skills, summary lines, experience bullets) from the recommended resume.
    *   Briefly explain why it's a better choice than other strong alternatives you considered.
