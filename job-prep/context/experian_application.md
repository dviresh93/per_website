# Experian - Senior Software Engineer (RAG Systems)

## Application Message

**Subject:** Senior Software Engineer - RAG Systems Application

Hi there,

I came across the Senior Software Engineer position focusing on RAG systems at Experian and wanted to reach out. The role requirements line up really well with what I've been working on lately.

I'm currently building GridCOP at Grid CoOperator - it's an intelligent agent that helps utility analysts query complex grid data using natural language instead of writing SQL. The system uses LangChain and vector databases for RAG workflows, and we've seen about 70% reduction in research time since deploying it.

Your job posting caught my attention because I've been working with exactly the tech stack you mentioned:
- Production experience with LangChain and RAG architectures
- Vector database integration for data retrieval
- Python 3.11+ with async programming
- AWS deployments with containerization

What I find interesting about this opportunity is the chance to work on RAG systems at Experian's scale. My background spans both the LLM/RAG technical side and the production engineering needed to make these systems reliable in real-world applications.

Would love to chat about how my experience building these systems could fit with what Experian is working on.

Thanks for your time,
Viresh
