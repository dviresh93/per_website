I have been a Drone Systems Engineer at Freefly Systems since 2021, where I optimize payload integration capabilities for mapping and inspection workflows across Altax and Astro drone platforms for enterprise clients. My experience includes developing diagnostic systems for field operations, technical crash analysis for inspection missions, and streamlining production workflows that support commercial mapping and infrastructure inspection applications.
