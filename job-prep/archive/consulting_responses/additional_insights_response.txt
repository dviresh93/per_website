In my experience, the biggest insight clients miss is that drones and vehicle-mounted systems are complementary, not competing technologiesâ€”mobile LiDAR excels at continuous linear infrastructure like highways and rail corridors where you need consistent coverage at traffic speeds, while drones provide access to vertical structures and confined spaces that ground systems simply cannot reach. The operational reality is that vehicle-mounted cameras work well for routine condition monitoring but struggle with detailed defect analysis due to distance limitations and environmental constraints, whereas drone platforms can achieve the close-proximity positioning needed for sub-millimeter crack detection. The most successful programs combine both approaches: mobile systems for baseline condition mapping and change detection over time, with targeted drone deployments for detailed investigation of specific problem areas identified in the mobile data.
