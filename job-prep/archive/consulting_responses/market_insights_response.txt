From my experience at Freefly, the market is shifting rapidly as traditional inspection methods become cost-prohibitive, with competition focused less on hardware (DJI dominates volume) and more on specialized solutions like Flyability's confined-space platforms or Skydio's autonomy. The real client challenges aren't technology adoptionâ€”they're operational: fleet maintenance requiring specialized knowledge, getting pilots trained for various field conditions, and navigating the complex process of payload integration while staying compliant with evolving regulations."
