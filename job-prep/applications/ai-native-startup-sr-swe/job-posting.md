- ⚠️ **Kubernetes/Terraform** (MINOR) - You have Docker and CI/CD; K8s/Terraform are natural extensions

**Transferable:**
- 🔄 Multi-agent orchestration → Distributed systems
- 🔄 GridCOP early-stage → Startup environment
- 🔄 Rapid iteration (70% in 2 months) → Fast-paced startup culture
- 🔄 Production AI at scale (200+ queries) → High-performance applications

## Interview Prep Focus

### Key Talking Points

**For "Tell me about your AI-first experience":**
> "I've built two production AI systems from the ground up. At GridCOP, I architected a multi-agent AI platform using LangChain and MCP that reduced analyst workflows by 70% in 2 months. At Freefly, I independently designed and deployed a full-stack AI diagnostic system with React frontend and Python Flask backend serving 200+ daily queries. Both involved modern AI tooling - RAG, vector search, foundation model APIs - integrated into production applications."

**For "Tell me about your startup experience":**
> "At GridCOP, I'm in an early-stage startup environment building from scratch. We went from concept to 70% workflow reduction in 2 months through rapid iteration and continuous deployment. I own the entire stack - architecture, development, deployment, monitoring. This mirrors the startup environment where you need to move fast, wear multiple hats, and deliver end-to-end solutions."

**For "Tell me about your full-stack experience":**
> "At Freefly, I independently built a full-stack AI system - React frontend with TypeScript, Python Flask REST APIs, RAG architecture with vector search, all containerized with Docker and deployed to production. I designed the UX, architected the backend, integrated the AI models, and deployed it - complete ownership from concept to 200+ daily users."

**For "Tell me about distributed systems/APIs":**
> "At GridCOP, I built a microservices architecture where specialized AI agents coordinate via RESTful APIs to process analytics. I designed event-driven architecture with monitoring dashboards, achieved 99%+ uptime through error handling and automated recovery. At Freefly, I built Python Flask REST APIs integrated with foundation model APIs - all about designing scalable, reliable distributed systems."

**Technical Stories:**
1. **AI-First Platform:** GridCOP multi-agent system (LangChain, MCP, microservices)
2. **Full Ownership:** Freefly system (concept → production, React + Python + Docker)
3. **Rapid Iteration:** 70% workflow reduction in 2 months (startup pace)
4. **Distributed Systems:** Multi-agent orchestration via APIs (scalability, reliability)
5. **Modern Stack:** Python, TypeScript, React, Docker, AWS (their tech preferences)

## Notes

- **Series A startup:** High growth potential, equity opportunity, some risk
- **Early-stage culture:** Emphasize your comfort with ambiguity, ownership mentality
- **AI-native:** They're building AI-first from day one - your expertise is their core need
- **Small team:** Highlight your ability to work independently and wear multiple hats
- **Recruiter partnership:** This posting mentions "partnering" - may be through a recruiter
- **Your unique value:** Sr. SWE who can build AI-first features is RARE - you're exactly what they need
