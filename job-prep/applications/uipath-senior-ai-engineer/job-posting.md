## Interview Prep Focus

### Key Talking Points

**For "Tell me about your agentic automation experience":**
> "At GridCOP, I built an agentic automation platform with autonomous agents that handle complex analytics tasks independently. I architected a multi-agent system using LangChain and MCP frameworks where specialized agents coordinate via APIs and event-driven architecture. Each agent has specific capabilities and they collaborate to solve complex problems. We deployed comprehensive evaluation pipelines and observability dashboards to ensure agent reliability and correct results, reducing analyst workflows by 70% in 2 months."

**For "How do you ensure agent reliability?":**
> "I've built agent reliability infrastructure with evaluation frameworks that measure quality, latency, and correctness. For GridCOP, we track metrics across 50-100 daily queries and achieved 99%+ uptime through robust error handling, automated recovery mechanisms, and human-in-the-loop feedback integration. We continuously improve agent performance by monitoring evaluation metrics and addressing issues proactively. For LLM challenges like hallucination and consistency, I've implemented RAG architecture with vector search to ground responses in factual data."

**For "Tell me about solving LLM challenges":**
> "At Freefly, I addressed LLM hallucination and consistency challenges by implementing RAG architecture with vector search using FAISS. Instead of relying solely on the LLM's parametric knowledge, we retrieve relevant context from our knowledge base and inject it into prompts. This significantly improved factual accuracy and consistency. I also built evaluation frameworks with automated testing and quality metrics to continuously monitor and improve reliability. We deployed this to production serving 200+ daily users with 80% reduction in analysis time."

**For "Tell me about your full-stack AI engineering experience":**
> "I've built end-to-end full-stack AI systems. At Freefly, I architected a React frontend with TypeScript and Python Flask REST APIs, integrated foundation model APIs (Ollama, Llama 3.2), and deployed to production. At GridCOP, I own the entire stack - from cloud-native backend services with microservices architecture and event-driven pipelines, to observability dashboards and monitoring, all deployed on AWS with Docker containerization and CI/CD pipelines. I collaborate cross-functionally with stakeholders to translate requirements into scalable solutions."

**For "Technical leadership and mentoring":**
> "At Freefly, I led release management coordinating cross-functional teams through alpha to production deployment. I established code review standards and mentored engineers on software engineering best practices. At GridCOP, I lead the technical architecture, drive technical roadmap discussions with business stakeholders, and implement best practices for LLMOps including prompt versioning, model evaluation, and observability. I believe in sharing knowledge through design reviews and helping engineers grow in their careers."
