# Job Analysis: AI Architect @ NTT DATA

## Role Overview
*   **Title:** AI Architect (Remote)
*   **Company:** NTT DATA
*   **Core Focus:** Designing/Implementing AI models, improving architectures, aligning AI with business strategy.
*   **Key Constraint:** "3-5 years supporting professional services sales cycle (proposals, RFPs)".

## Fit Assessment
*   **Technical Fit:** High. You have the AI/ML implementation and system design experience (GridCOP, Freefly).
*   **Architecture Fit:** High. You've built multi-agent systems and data pipelines from scratch.
*   **Sales/Proposal Fit:** Low/Medium. This is the main gap. We need to reframe your experience to highlight "Technical Pre-sales", "Stakeholder Management", "Requirements Gathering", and "Strategic Planning".

## Customization Strategy
### 1. Summary
*   **Pivot:** From "AI Engineer" to "AI Architect".
*   **Narrative:** "AI Architect with 7+ years experience designing scalable enterprise AI systems..."
*   **Keywords:** Architecture, Business Strategy, Compliance, Stakeholder Management, System Design.

### 2. Experience Reframing (Bridging the Sales Gap)
*   **GridCOP:** Emphasize the *design* and *stakeholder* aspect. "Architected multi-agent system...", "Defined technical strategy for..."
*   **Freefly:** Highlight "Product Roadmap" contributions and "Cross-functional leadership" (already in bullets, but we can emphasize).
*   **Lumenier/York:** Keep the "Applied AI" angle but mention "Prototyping for product roadmap" (already there, good).

### 3. Projects
*   **GridCOP:** Keep. It's your best "Architecture" example.
*   **Production Tool:** Rename to "Enterprise AI Architecture Optimization"? Focus on *improving existing architectures*.
*   **Travel Planner:** Maybe replace? Do we have something more "Enterprise/Strategy"?
    *   *Idea:* Maybe stick with "Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance" as it shows "Safety/Compliance" (critical for this role).

### 4. Skills
*   **Add:** System Design, Solution Architecture, Technical Strategy, Stakeholder Management, Compliance, Regulatory Requirements.
