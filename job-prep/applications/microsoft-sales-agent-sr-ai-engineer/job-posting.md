## Resume Customizations

### **Freefly Bullet 1:** Used `ai_engineer_azure` variation
```
"Independently designed and built AI-powered diagnostic tool using Python and LLM frameworks (Ollama, Llama 3.2), deployed on Azure infrastructure serving production users, integrated with cloud services for scalable inference and monitoring"
```

**Why:** Emphasizes Azure deployment (matches their tech stack)

### **Skills Highlighted:**
- Programming: Python, C++, **C#**, JavaScript, TypeScript ✅
- Cloud: AWS, **Azure**, GCP ✅
- AI/ML: MCP, LangChain, **Fine-tuning**, **LoRA**, **deepeval**, **LangSmith** ✅
- Data: **Data Pipelines**, **ETL** ✅

### **Projects:**
- GridCOP: Shows MCP + multi-agent + LangSmith + deepeval + data pipeline
- Freefly Tool: Shows full-stack + production deployment
- Travel Planner: Shows agentic AI development

## Interview Talking Points

### **On MCP:**
> "In GridCOP, I used the Model Context Protocol to enable agent-to-agent communication. We had specialized agents for different tasks - a query planner, a SQL generator, and a result formatter - all coordinating through MCP. This let us build composable, modular agents instead of a monolithic system."

### **On Fine-tuning for CRM Domain:**
> "At Freefly, I fine-tuned Llama 3.2 on drone telemetry data because the base model struggled with domain terminology. For a CRM agent, I'd use the same approach - fine-tune on sales conversations, opportunity data, and CRM-specific language to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinations."

### **On Prompt Evaluation:**
> "I use deepeval to measure RAG quality - context precision, answer relevancy, faithfulness. For the diagnostic tool, we tracked these metrics in production and iteratively refined prompts when scores dropped. For a sales agent, I'd measure accuracy on CRM tasks like opportunity summarization or next-best-action recommendations."

### **On Azure:**
> "I deployed the Freefly diagnostic tool on Azure infrastructure, integrating with cloud services for scalable inference and monitoring. I'm familiar with Azure deployment patterns and excited to work with Azure OpenAI and the broader Microsoft AI stack."

  - Fine-tuning, deepeval, LangSmith visibility
  - Data pipelines

- **MCP experience is your biggest differentiator** - most candidates won't have this

- **Microsoft ecosystem gap is acceptable** - most external candidates lack this, they'll train you
