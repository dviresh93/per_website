=========================================================

Hi Callum,

I just applied for the Senior AI Engineer role at Calyptus and wanted to reach out directly.

Quick background - I've been building production AI systems for the last few years. Most recently a multi-agent system at Grid CoOperator using LangChain and MCP for smart grid analytics (deployed on AWS, cut research time by 70%). Before that an AI diagnostic chatbot at Freefly with WebSocket streaming that's processing 200+ queries daily.

The role caught my eye because it's basically the full stack of what I've been working on - multi-agent orchestration, RAG, MCP servers, building chatbots that work in production.

Portfolio with demos: https://viresh-duvvuri.netlify.app/

Would love to chat if there's a fit. You can reach me here or at vireshduvvuri@gmail.com.

Best,
Viresh
