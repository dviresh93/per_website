## NOTES FOR PDF GENERATION

**Emphasis for Senior AI Engineer (Mortgage Tech) role:**
1. Agentic AI experience (multi-agent, chatbots, voice-ready architecture)
2. Full-stack capability (React + Python, REST APIs, WebSocket)
3. RAG and MCP experience (GridCOP)
4. Regulated industry experience (utilities = compliance-heavy like mortgage)
5. Twilio notifications (Grid CoOperator monitoring)
6. Fast-paced startup environment (Grid CoOperator, Freefly)
7. Production AI systems with scalability and reliability

**Perfect alignment:**
- ✅ 5+ years full-stack experience
- ✅ Agentic AI (GridCOP multi-agent orchestration)
- ✅ Chatbots (Freefly diagnostic chatbot with WebSocket)
- ✅ RAG experience (both projects)
- ✅ MCP servers (GridCOP explicitly uses MCP)
- ✅ Cloud microservices (AWS, Docker)
- ✅ Master's degree in Computer Science
- ✅ Fast-paced startup (Grid CoOperator, Freefly)
- ✅ WebSocket (Freefly chatbot)
- ✅ Twilio (Grid CoOperator notifications)

**Gaps acknowledged:**
- Node.js/TypeScript: "JavaScript proficient, TypeScript learning" (React + Python strong)
- Mortgage domain: No experience, but regulated utility industry shows compliance understanding

**Title:** Use "Senior AI Engineer" (matches exactly)

**REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Check if summary emphasizes chatbots, agentic AI, regulated industries
2. Verify Grid CoOperator mentions Twilio notifications
3. Verify Freefly mentions WebSocket streaming chatbot
4. Confirm skills section highlights agentic AI + full-stack
5. Ensure projects show chatbot/agent experience with production deployment
6. Check if overall narrative positions you as someone who builds AI agents that scale in compliance-heavy environments

**Once approved, I'll generate PDF with template #1**
