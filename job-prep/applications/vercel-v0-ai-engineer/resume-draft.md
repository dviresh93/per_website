## NOTES FOR PDF GENERATION

**Emphasis for Vercel v0 role:**
1. Full-stack capability (React + Python)
2. Developer tool building (tools engineers love to use)
3. UX/UI iteration based on user feedback
4. LLM experience (prompt engineering, RAG, agent orchestration)
5. Rapid prototyping and experimentation
6. A/B testing mindset and evaluation metrics
7. Bridge research → production

**Gaps acknowledged:**
- TypeScript: "learning" (show willingness, you have React/JS experience)
- Tailwind: "familiar" (you can learn quickly)
- Fine-tuning: Not mentioned (focus on prompt engineering and practical LLM deployment)

**Location:** "Open to SF/NY/Remote" to show flexibility for hybrid roles

---

**REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Check if summary captures the role requirements
2. Verify work experience emphasizes frontend + AI + developer tools
3. Confirm skills section highlights React/JS alongside Python
4. Ensure projects show full-stack capability and UX iteration
5. Check if overall narrative positions you as someone who builds AI tools developers love

**Once approved, I'll generate PDF with template #1**
