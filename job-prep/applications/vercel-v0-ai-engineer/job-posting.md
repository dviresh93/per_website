# Vercel - AI Engineer (v0)

## Company Overview
Vercel gives developers the tools and cloud infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. Team behind v0, Next.js, and AI SDK. Customers: Ramp, Supreme, PayPal, Under Armour. Mission: Enable the world to ship the best products.

## Team: v0
Fast-moving group building the future of UI development with AI. Working on v0.dev - a cutting-edge generative design tool that turns natural language into functional, beautiful React components using Tailwind CSS, leveraging large language models and novel research in human-AI collaboration.

## Role Focus
AI Engineer sitting at the intersection of machine learning, product development, and frontend engineering. Work with product designers, ML scientists, and full-stack engineers to prototype and deploy innovative systems that redefine how developers and designers build interfaces.

## Job Requirements

**Core Requirements:**
- **3+ years** in research engineering, applied ML, or related fields - REQUIRED
- **Python + JavaScript/TypeScript** - Strong programming skills - CRITICAL
- **LLM experience** - Working with or fine-tuning LLMs (OpenAI, Hugging Face) - CRITICAL
- **Modern frontend** - React, Tailwind, etc. - REQUIRED
- Creative and practical thinker who thrives in ambiguity
- Eye for design and developer ergonomics

**Responsibilities:**
- Design and develop prototypes exploring new interaction paradigms powered by LLMs
- Research and implement state-of-the-art models and prompting strategies for UI generation and code synthesis
- Build and fine-tune internal tools, datasets, and evaluation pipelines
- Run A/B tests and user experiments to validate hypotheses and improve generation quality
- Bridge the gap between research and production—bring cutting-edge techniques into stable, scalable environment

**Technologies:**
- LLMs: OpenAI, Hugging Face
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Languages: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Focus areas: UI generation, code synthesis, prompting strategies
- Product: v0.dev (generative design tool)

## Fit Assessment (85%)

**Strengths:**
- **Full-Stack AI Engineering:** Python + TypeScript/React production experience (EXACT match)
- **LLM Production Experience:** Foundation model APIs (Ollama, Llama 3.2, Claude) in production systems
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** Built evaluation pipelines for GridCOP (model quality, cost, latency)
- **Rapid Prototyping:** 70% efficiency gains in 2 months through fast iteration (perfect for v0's pace)
- **Research → Production:** Proven ability to take cutting-edge AI from prototype to production
- **Frontend + AI:** Rare combination - built TypeScript/React AI tool serving 200+ daily users
- **A/B Testing & Validation:** HIL evaluation, user experiments for model quality
- **Prompt Engineering:** Production prompt engineering with iterative optimization
- **Consumer-Facing AI:** Experience building AI tools for end users (not just internal)

**Gaps:**
- **UI Generation/Code Synthesis:** No direct experience (but understand LLM capabilities for code generation)
- **Fine-Tuning LLMs:** Strong prompt engineering, limited fine-tuning experience
- **Tailwind CSS:** Know React/CSS fundamentals, not Tailwind specifically (highly learnable)
- **Design Background:** Engineering-focused, but built user-facing tools

**Overall Assessment:**
Strong fit (85%). You have the exact technical foundation they need: Python, TypeScript/React, production LLM experience, evaluation frameworks, and rapid prototyping skills. The role is about building generative UI tools powered by AI - you've built production GenAI tools. v0 needs someone who can bridge research → production with full-stack skills, which is exactly your background (GridCOP multi-agent system, Freefly production tool). Main gap is UI generation domain, but your LLM experience, frontend skills, and proven learning ability (robotics → AI) position you well.

  - Consumer-facing AI tools
  - Frontend engineering

- **Metrics to highlight:**
  - 200+ daily queries (production scale)
  - 70-80% efficiency improvements
  - Hours to minutes (user impact)
  - 6 weeks to production (rapid deployment)

**Tailoring Notes:**
- Summary: Emphasize full-stack AI (Python + TypeScript/React), LLM production tools, rapid prototyping, consumer-facing AI
- Skills: Programming first (Python, TypeScript, React), then AI/ML frameworks
- Freefly bullet 1: Lead with TypeScript/React + LLM production tool (200+ users)
- GridCOP: Emphasize evaluation frameworks, prompt engineering, production deployment
- Production Tool project: LEAD with this - it's the perfect match (TypeScript/React + LLM + consumer-facing)
- De-emphasize: Embedded/robotics background (keep it but don't lead)
- Emphasize: Frontend + AI combination, rapid iteration, user-facing products
