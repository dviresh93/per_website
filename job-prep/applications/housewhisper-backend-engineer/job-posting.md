- Bias toward action, ship fast
- Experience with queues, cron jobs, APIs, data streams
- Turned fuzzy ideas into real, usable systems
- Made LLMs work: reliably, observably, in production
- Comfortable in-office with team

**Technical:**
- Backend systems at scale
- Production AI/LLM deployment
- Event-driven architectures
- Fast feedback loops (observability, feature toggles, dashboards)
- Real user production experience

**Bonus:**
- Built tooling for yourself, then made it usable for others
- Launched scrappy MVP → real business/feature
- LLM observability experience
- Shipped AI features, seen what breaks with users

### What They Offer
- Ship real features every week
- Talk to real users
- Fast, stable, easy-to-improve systems
- Salary, equity, health insurance, lunch, dogs
- Fast commute (Seattle-based)

### Culture

- Care deeply
- Real features over roadmap decks
- Past "will this work?" phase - agents using product to close deals
- Fast feedback loops with engaged users

## Fit Assessment

### Fit Score: 83%

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Production LLM experience (Freefly: 200+ daily queries)
- ✅ Agentic AI expertise (GridCOP multi-agent system)
- ✅ Backend systems & APIs (5+ years Python, FastAPI, Flask, AWS)
- ✅ Fast iteration culture (70% workflow reduction in 2 months)
- ✅ Low-latency systems (PX4 real-time embedded background)
- ✅ Built tools that scaled (diagnostic tool: internal → production)

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Telephonics/Voice AI (MODERATE) - No explicit voice/telephony experience
- ⚠️ Event-driven architecture (MINOR) - Have data pipelines, not explicit event-driven messaging
- ⚠️ Real estate domain (MINOR) - No domain background (but they teach)

**Transferable:**
- 🔄 Multi-agent orchestration → Event-driven architecture
- 🔄 Real-time embedded → Low-latency backend
- 🔄 Domain-specific AI (drones) → Domain-specific AI (real estate)

## Resume Customization Strategy

**Positioning:** Backend engineer with production agentic AI experience

**Summary:** Emphasize:
- Backend systems + production AI
- Fast iteration and shipping culture
- Event-driven architectures
- Low-latency APIs

**Freefly Bullet 1:** Backend architecture focus
- Python Flask REST API backend
- Event-driven data processing pipelines
- Observability and monitoring
- Rapid prototyping with engineering teams

**Projects Selected:**
1. **GridCOP** - Agentic AI systems (LangChain, MCP)
2. **Production Tool** - Backend scale (200+ queries, Flask, production deployment)
3. **AI Travel Planner** - Conversational AI (LangChain, real-time data)

**Skills Order:**
1. Programming (Python, backend frameworks)
2. AI/ML Frameworks
3. Cloud & Infrastructure
4. Data & Analytics

## Application Timeline

- **Analyzed:** 2025-11-11
- **Resume Generated:** 2025-11-11
- **Status:** Ready to apply

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Resume generated and validated
2. [ ] Apply through company portal
3. [ ] Network with HouseWhisper team on LinkedIn (find former Zillow connections)
4. [ ] Prepare for initial screen (focus on production AI + backend stories)

## Notes

- They explicitly want in-office (Seattle) - confirm commute works
- Early stage (seed) - high impact potential but risk
- Founded by Zillow alumni - leverage real estate tech background
- Emphasis on "bias toward action" - highlight 2-month GridCOP deployment
- "Move fast" culture matches your rapid iteration track record
