---

## Role Summary

**Team:** Applied AI team (NEW - you'd be one of the first)
**Mission:** Bring intelligent automation and agentic workflows across company (internal ops + customer experience)
**Scope:** End-to-end AI implementation - identify use cases, design, deploy, measure outcomes, enable teams

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Build and ship AI-powered workflows** using LLMs, APIs, automation frameworks
2. **Identify high-impact AI opportunities** for operational efficiency or customer experience
3. **Collaborate with product/engineering** to integrate agentic capabilities into Latitude.sh systems
4. **Lead internal enablement:** docs, workshops, champion best practices
5. **Track impact** with clear metrics and iterate on solutions

---

## Required Skills

### Technical
- ✅ Hands-on experience with LLMs or agent frameworks (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, custom pipelines)
- ✅ Strong software engineering fundamentals (Python, APIs, orchestration, prompt design)
- ✅ Curiosity to experiment, move fast, communicate results clearly
- ✅ Mid- to senior-level engineer

### Your Match
- ✅ **LLM experience:** GridCOP (LangChain), Freefly (Ollama, Llama)
- ✅ **Agent frameworks:** LangChain, LangGraph, multi-agent orchestration
- ✅ **Python + APIs:** Flask, FastAPI, REST, WebSocket
- ✅ **Prompt engineering:** Context engineering for both projects
- ✅ **Move fast:** GridCOP refactor in 1 week, Freefly RAG tool in 6 weeks
- ✅ **Mid-senior level:** 5+ years experience
- ✅ **Custom pipelines:** Built custom agent orchestration with MCP

## What They Offer

- **Contractor (PJ)** - Brazilian contractor status (need to clarify remote/international work)
- Paid Time Off
- Competitive Compensation
- Wellhub (Gympass)
- Annual Bonus (company/team performance)
- Flexible work hours
- Professional growth opportunities

---

## Fit Assessment

**Overall Fit: 95/100** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

### Strengths
1. **Agentic AI expertise** - your core competency (GridCOP multi-agent system)
2. **End-to-end ownership** - matches your experience building full systems
3. **First AI engineer** - greenfield opportunity to shape strategy
4. **Infrastructure domain** - similar to Forward Networks (complex systems)
5. **Move fast culture** - matches your startup background
6. **Contractor status** - potentially better for F2 visa than W2

### Potential Challenges
1. **Contractor (PJ) status** - need to understand if this is remote international work or Brazil-based
2. **No domain knowledge** - bare metal infrastructure (but you learn fast)
3. **Internal tooling focus** - less customer-facing than your previous work (but you've built internal tools at Freefly)

### Questions to Ask
1. Is this role remote internationally, or Brazil-based?
2. Can contractor status work for someone on F2 visa in the US?
3. What's the current state of AI at Latitude.sh? (greenfield or enhancing existing?)
4. What are the top 3 use cases you want to tackle first?

## Resume Customization Strategy

**Positioning:** "AI Engineer who builds end-to-end agentic systems that ship and deliver measurable impact"

### Key Messages
1. **Agentic workflows specialist** - GridCOP multi-agent orchestration
2. **End-to-end builder** - from prototype to production with metrics
3. **Fast shipper** - measurable results in weeks, not months
4. **Internal tooling experience** - Freefly diagnostic tool for engineering teams
5. **Infrastructure mindset** - embedded systems background = understanding complex systems

### Projects to Emphasize
1. **GridCOP** - multi-agent system, LangChain, measurable impact (70% time reduction)
2. **Freefly RAG tool** - internal engineering tool, 200+ daily queries, 80% productivity gain
3. **AI Travel Planner** - end-to-end AI app (shows breadth)

### Skills to Highlight
- LangChain, LangGraph, multi-agent orchestration
- OpenAI API, Claude API, Ollama (show LLM breadth)
- Python, FastAPI, REST APIs, WebSocket
- Prompt engineering, context engineering
- Metrics/evaluation (70% reduction, 80% improvement)
- Internal enablement (you've documented and shared knowledge)

---

## Application Strategy

### Step 1: Research
- [x] Analyze job posting
- [ ] Research Latitude.sh platform (understand bare metal infrastructure)
- [ ] Find Latitude.sh team on LinkedIn (identify hiring manager/team lead)
- [ ] Check if they have engineering blog (understand their tech stack)

### Step 2: Clarify Contractor Status
**CRITICAL:** Before investing time, clarify if PJ contractor works for F2 visa holder in US
- Email/message asking about remote international contractor arrangements
- Or just apply and ask during screening

### Step 3: Resume
- Customize resume emphasizing agentic workflows, end-to-end ownership, measurable impact
- Use "AI Engineer" title (matches exactly)
- Lead with GridCOP (agentic) and Freefly (internal tooling)

### Step 4: Cover Letter / Application Message
- Hook: "I build agentic AI systems that ship and deliver measurable impact"
- GridCOP: 70% time reduction, multi-agent orchestration
- Freefly: Internal tool serving 200+ daily queries
- Why Latitude: First AI engineer on applied AI team = shape the future
- Infrastructure parallel: Embedded systems background = understanding complex systems

### Step 5: Network
- Find team members on LinkedIn
- If possible, reach out to hiring manager or AI team lead
- Reference your experience building AI for infrastructure/operations

## Key Talking Points

### "Why Latitude.sh?"
*"What excites me is being one of the first AI engineers on the applied AI team. I've built agentic workflows from scratch at GridCOP and internal AI tools at Freefly - this is exactly the type of end-to-end ownership I thrive in. Your infrastructure platform reminds me of the complex systems I've worked with in robotics and embedded systems. I'm excited to bring that systems thinking to building AI that makes your teams more efficient."*

### "What makes you qualified?"
*"I've already done what you're hiring for. At GridCOP, I built a multi-agent system using LangChain that reduced analyst research time by 70% - measured impact from day one. At Freefly, I built an internal AI diagnostic tool that serves 200+ queries daily and improved engineer productivity by 80%. I move fast - the Freefly tool went from prototype to production in 6 weeks. And I know how to enable teams - I documented patterns, ran workshops, and made AI accessible to non-AI engineers."*

### "Contractor status concerns?"
*"I saw this is a contractor (PJ) role. I'm currently on F2 visa in the US - I'd love to understand if there's flexibility for remote international contractors or if this requires Brazil-based presence. Happy to discuss different arrangements that could work."*

## Timeline

- **Day 1 (Today):** Research company, create resume, apply
- **Day 2-3:** Network on LinkedIn, find team members
- **Week 1:** Follow up if no response
- **Ongoing:** Track application in master tracker

---

## Notes

**Contractor (PJ) Research Needed:**
- PJ = Pessoa Jurídica (Brazilian legal entity for contractors)
- Need to clarify: Can F2 visa holder in US work as international contractor?
- Alternative: Is this role flexible for US-based W2 if contractor doesn't work?

**Company Context:**
- Bare metal infrastructure = physical servers (not virtualized like AWS EC2)
- Developer-centric = strong API, programmatic deployment
- Single-tenant = dedicated hardware (vs multi-tenant cloud)
- Founded 2019 = mature startup (not pre-product)

**Similar to:**
- Forward Networks (infrastructure + AI)
- Cloudflare (developer-centric infrastructure)
- Vercel (fast, easy developer tools)
