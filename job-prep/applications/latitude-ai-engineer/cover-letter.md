# Cover Letter / Application Message - Latitude.sh AI Engineer

---

## SHORT VERSION (For application form)

I build agentic AI systems that ship and deliver measurable impact.

Most recently, I shipped a multi-agent system at Grid CoOperator using LangChain and MCP that reduced analyst research time by 70% within 2 months. Before that, I built an internal AI diagnostic tool at Freefly serving 200+ daily queries that improved engineer productivity by 80%.

What excites me about Latitude.sh is being one of the first AI engineers on your applied AI team. I've already done this work - identifying high-impact AI opportunities, building end-to-end solutions from prototype to production, and enabling teams through documentation and workshops.

I move fast (Freefly tool went from idea to production in 6 weeks), I measure impact (every project has clear metrics), and I know how to make AI work in real-world operations, not just demos.

## LONG VERSION (Detailed cover letter if requested)

**Subject: Application for AI Engineer - Applied AI Team**

Dear Latitude.sh Hiring Team,

I'm writing to apply for the AI Engineer position on your applied AI team. As one of the first engineers building AI capabilities at Latitude.sh, I see an opportunity to do exactly what I've done at my previous companies: identify high-impact AI use cases, build end-to-end solutions, and deliver measurable operational improvements.

**End-to-End Agentic Systems That Ship**

At Grid CoOperator, I built a multi-agent analytics system from scratch using LangChain, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol (MCP). The system coordinates specialized agents for complex database querying, online research, and insights generation. Within 2 months of deployment, we measured a 70% reduction in analyst research time, with the system handling 50-100 daily automated queries on AWS infrastructure with full monitoring and evaluation metrics.

At Freefly Systems, I identified an opportunity to automate diagnostic workflows that were taking hours of expert time. I built a full-stack internal AI tool (React frontend, Python Flask backend, integrated with Ollama and Llama 3.2 APIs) that shipped to production and now serves 200+ daily queries. Engineer productivity improved by 80%, and we reduced support resolution time from hours to minutes.

**Rapid Prototyping and Measurable Impact**

I move fast and measure outcomes. The Freefly AI tool went from initial prototype to production deployment in 6 weeks. Both GridCOP and Freefly have clear metrics tracking business impact: time savings, query volume, user satisfaction, and ROI.

I don't build AI demos - I build production systems with evaluation frameworks, monitoring dashboards, cost tracking, and continuous improvement loops based on user feedback.

**Internal Enablement and Team Collaboration**

At both Grid CoOperator and Freefly, I led internal enablement efforts:
- Documented AI patterns and best practices for non-AI engineers
- Ran workshops with business stakeholders to translate requirements into technical solutions
- Established prompt engineering guidelines and model evaluation frameworks
- Made AI accessible to domain experts who don't have ML backgrounds

This is critical for an applied AI team - the goal isn't just to build AI systems, but to enable the entire company to leverage AI responsibly and effectively.

**Systems Thinking from Infrastructure Background**

Before AI, I spent 5+ years in robotics and embedded systems (PX4 flight control, autonomous drones, real-time systems). This background gives me strong systems thinking for infrastructure challenges:
- Understanding complex distributed systems (networks, state machines, data flows)
- Building for reliability and performance constraints
- Debugging production issues with incomplete information
- Balancing innovation with operational stability

Latitude.sh's bare metal infrastructure platform requires this kind of systems mindset - I understand the constraints and trade-offs of building on top of complex infrastructure.

**Why Latitude.sh?**

What excites me about this role is the opportunity to be one of the first AI engineers defining how AI is applied across Latitude.sh. I've done this before (GridCOP was greenfield, Freefly was the first AI initiative), and I thrive in environments where I can identify opportunities, experiment rapidly, and deliver measurable value.

Your developer-centric culture resonates with me - I've always focused on building tools that developers actually want to use, not just impressive technology for its own sake.

**Technical Stack Alignment**

My experience directly matches your requirements:
- **LLM frameworks:** LangChain, LangGraph, custom pipelines
- **APIs:** OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Ollama, REST APIs, WebSocket
- **Software engineering:** Python, JavaScript, FastAPI, Flask, React, SQL
- **Orchestration:** Multi-agent systems, MCP, agent coordination
- **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3, CloudWatch), Docker, Kubernetes
- **Evaluation:** Model evaluation frameworks, A/B testing, metrics tracking

**Contractor Status Question**

I noticed this role is listed as "Contractor (PJ)" status. I'm currently based in the US on F2 visa - I'd love to understand if there's flexibility for remote international contractors or if this requires Brazil-based presence. I'm open to discussing different arrangements that could work.

**Next Steps**

I'd love to discuss how I can help build AI capabilities at Latitude.sh. I'm available for a call at your convenience and happy to dive deeper into any of the projects I've mentioned.

## KEY TALKING POINTS FOR INTERVIEW

### "Why are you interested in Latitude.sh?"

*"Three things drew me to Latitude.sh. First, you're building the applied AI team from scratch - I've done exactly this at GridCOP and Freefly, and I thrive in that greenfield environment where I can define how AI is applied across the company.*

*Second, your infrastructure platform resonates with my background. I spent years in embedded systems and robotics working with complex distributed systems, real-time constraints, and performance optimization. That systems thinking translates directly to building AI on top of infrastructure platforms.*

*Third, you value end-to-end ownership and moving fast - that's exactly how I work. I don't just prototype, I ship. Freefly tool went from idea to 200+ daily production queries in 6 weeks."*

### "What's your experience with agentic AI?"

*"I've built two production agentic systems. GridCOP is a multi-agent analytics system using LangChain and LangGraph where specialized agents coordinate through MCP - one agent queries databases, another retrieves online context, and they collaborate to generate insights. We measured 70% reduction in analyst research time.*

*At Freefly, I built an AI diagnostic agent that autonomously analyzes drone crash logs, retrieves relevant technical documentation through RAG, and generates diagnostic recommendations. It's serving 200+ queries daily and improved engineer productivity by 80%.*

*Both systems have evaluation frameworks tracking quality metrics, latency, and user satisfaction. I've learned a lot about when agents work well (clear task boundaries, good tool design) and when they struggle (ambiguous goals, poor error handling)."*

### "How do you identify high-impact AI opportunities?"

*"I start by talking to the people doing the work. At Freefly, I shadowed support engineers and saw them spending hours manually analyzing logs - that became the diagnostic tool. At GridCOP, I worked with grid analysts and noticed they were writing the same SQL queries repeatedly with slight variations - that became the multi-agent system.*

*Then I look for three criteria: Is this a repetitive workflow that's taking expert time? Can AI realistically improve it (not just automate, but actually make it better)? Can we measure the impact clearly? If all three are yes, it's worth prototyping.*

*I also prioritize internal tooling - it's often the highest ROI because you can iterate quickly with direct user feedback, and the stakes are lower than customer-facing AI."*

### "How do you approach enabling teams to use AI?"

*"Documentation, demos, and workshops - in that order. First, I write clear docs explaining what the AI can and can't do, with concrete examples. At Freefly, I created a guide showing engineers how to write good prompts for the diagnostic tool.*

*Then I do demos - show, don't tell. I walk through real examples of using the tool to solve actual problems they're facing.*

*Finally, workshops for best practices - prompt engineering, evaluation metrics, responsible AI use. At GridCOP, I ran sessions with business analysts showing them how to verify AI outputs and when to trust the system vs. when to double-check.*

*The key is making AI accessible without overselling it - I'm honest about limitations and failure cases."*

### "Contractor status - can you work as PJ?"

*"I saw this is listed as contractor (PJ) status. I'm currently in the US on F2 visa, which has work authorization constraints. I'm open to discussing different arrangements - is this role flexible for remote international contractors, or does it require Brazil-based presence?*

*I'm genuinely interested in finding a way to make this work - the role is a perfect fit for my experience, and I'm excited about what Latitude.sh is building."*
