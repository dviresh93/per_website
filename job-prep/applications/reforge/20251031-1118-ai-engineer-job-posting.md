## Role Description

As an AI Engineer at Reforge, you will play a key role in shaping how our platform uses large language models to deliver value to customers. You'll focus on building and improving LLM-powered products and features – from crafting high-quality prompts to evaluating and tuning model outputs for optimal performance.

This is a highly collaborative, product-focused role where you'll work closely with product managers and engineers to turn cutting-edge AI capabilities into practical features. This position is fully remote, so we're looking for someone who is self-motivated and excels at clear, asynchronous communication within a distributed team.

## Key Responsibilities

### Prompt Engineering
Design, experiment with, and refine prompts and system instructions to maximize the effectiveness and reliability of LLMs across Reforge's products.

### LLM-Powered Features
Collaborate with product and engineering teams to develop and integrate new backend features powered by LLMs, enhancing our Insight Analytics platform with intelligent capabilities.

### Continuous Improvement
Continuously evaluate the quality of LLM outputs via internal testing and user feedback. Iterate on prompts, model settings, or data pipelines to improve performance over time and deliver a better user experience.

### Model Evaluation
Design and implement evaluation frameworks to assess LLM performance across different use cases. Monitor key metrics and develop automated testing pipelines to ensure consistent quality.

### Coding & Integration
Write and maintain code (primarily in TypeScript, with some Python) to implement support for LLM interactions – including building retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, working with vector embeddings, and handling content chunking of large documents.

**Important:** A majority of your work will be in-code shipping product — not in prompting tools or notebooks.
