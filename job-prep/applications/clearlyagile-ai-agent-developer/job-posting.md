# AI Agent Developer (LLM Specialist) - ClearlyAgile

**Company:** ClearlyAgile
**Location:** Tampa Bay area (likely remote-friendly)
**Role Type:** AI Engineer / LLM Specialist
**Application Date:** 2025-11-10

## Job Description

The AI Agent Developer is responsible for designing, building, and deploying intelligent autonomous or semi-autonomous agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). This role focuses on enabling complex workflows, reasoning capabilities, system integration, and secure data interaction across enterprise environments.

## Key Responsibilities

### Agent Design & Development
- Architect and implement AI-powered agents using LLMs (GPT, Claude, Llama, Mistral, Gemini)
- Develop prompt workflows, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multi-step reasoning
- Configure agent behaviors for decision-making, task execution, and contextual understanding
- Implement function calling, tool use, or API integration to extend agent capabilities

### System Integration
- Connect agents to internal systems, databases, knowledge bases, and APIs
- Use frameworks such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, Semantic Kernel, or custom pipelines
- Implement connectors for CRMs, ERPs, ticketing platforms, or document repositories

### Data & Knowledge Management
- Create structured and unstructured knowledge retrieval mechanisms
- Build and manage vector databases (Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, Milvus, Azure AI Search)
- Implement embeddings, chunking strategies, metadata tagging, and query optimization

### Workflow Automation
- Design agent orchestration pipelines to handle multi-agent collaboration
- Enable agents to automate research, reporting, email drafting, document processing, and customer interactions
- Integrate with workflow tools like Zapier, Airflow, UiPath, or Power Automate

### Model Optimization & Evaluation
- Fine-tune or customize LLMs using organization-specific data
- Evaluate model performance for accuracy, latency, cost, hallucinations, and compliance
- Apply guardrails, prompt validation, and reinforcement techniques

### Security, Ethics & Compliance
- Enforce data privacy and governance standards (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, ISO, CCPA)
- Implement role-based access and secure API token handling
- Apply content filtering, moderation, and usage monitoring

### Collaboration & Documentation
- Work with cross-functional teams (engineering, design, product, legal, security)
- Maintain technical documentation, agent configuration logs, and deployment playbooks
- Train internal teams on capabilities and responsible use

## Requirements

### Technical Stack
- Experience with Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, or Go
- Familiarity with API development (REST, GraphQL, JSON)
- Experience with cloud platforms: Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI, or Hugging Face
- Knowledge of vector databases and retrieval architectures

### AI/ML Expertise
- Strong understanding of LLM architectures, embeddings, prompt engineering, and RAG
- Experience with fine-tuning or model adaptation techniques
- Familiarity with agent frameworks (LangChain Agents, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel)

### Bonus Skills
- Experience building chatbots, copilots, or domain-specific assistants
- Knowledge of event-driven architecture, microservices, or serverless functions
- Exposure to MLOps or LLMOps tooling

## Company Culture & Values

## Fit Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Multi-agent systems (GridCOP project is perfect match)
- ✅ LangChain expertise (exact framework mentioned)
- ✅ RAG implementation (Drone Log Analysis + GridCOP)
- ✅ Vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone experience)
- ✅ Production deployment (AWS/Azure)
- ✅ Python mastery
- ✅ Prompt engineering
- ✅ Model evaluation frameworks
- ✅ Cross-functional collaboration

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ No explicit TypeScript/JavaScript/Go (have JavaScript from projects)
- ⚠️ Limited exposure to AutoGen, CrewAI (but have LangChain)
- ⚠️ No mentioned experience with workflow tools (Zapier, Airflow, UiPath)

**Transferable Skills:**
- Embedded systems → Understanding of system integration and APIs
- Robotics → Multi-system coordination and orchestration
- Drone log analysis → Agent tool use and function calling

**Fit Score:** 90/100 (Excellent Match)

## Customization Strategy

1. **Summary:** Emphasize autonomous agent development, multi-agent orchestration, LangChain frameworks
2. **Skills:** Lead with AI/ML Frameworks (Agentic AI, LangChain, RAG, Multi-Agent Systems)
3. **Projects:** All 3 projects showcase relevant capabilities:
   - GridCOP: Multi-agent orchestration (perfect match)
   - Production Tool: RAG + LLM integration
   - AI Travel Planner: Agent frameworks + Claude
4. **Work Experience:** Highlight GenAI agent work at Freefly, multi-agent systems at Grid CoOperator
