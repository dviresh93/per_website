## Interview Prep Focus

### Key Talking Points

**For "Tell me about your agentic systems experience":**
> "I've built production agentic systems for the past 2+ years. At GridCOP, I partnered with energy sector stakeholders through workshops and POCs to deploy a multi-agent analytics platform using LangChain and MCP. We implemented intelligent orchestration and retrieval that reduced analyst workflows by 70% in 2 months, serving 50-100 daily queries in production with 99%+ uptime."

**For "How do you work with clients/stakeholders":**
> "At GridCOP, I partnered directly with energy sector stakeholders, conducting design workshops and POC sessions to translate their domain-specific needs into technical solutions. I collaborated cross-functionally to define the technical roadmap, rapidly prototyped agentic workflows, and iterated based on stakeholder feedback. This client-embedded approach helped us achieve 70% workflow reduction in just 2 months."

**For "Tell me about agent evaluation and reliability":**
> "I've engineered agent architecture with comprehensive evaluation harnesses measuring quality, latency, safety, and cost effectiveness. At GridCOP, we implemented lifecycle observability dashboards, automated testing pipelines, and human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms. This approach achieved 99%+ uptime through robust error handling and continuous improvement of agent accuracy. We track key metrics to measure and improve agent performance in production."

**For "Domain-specific workflows experience":**
> "I've built agentic workflows for two domains: energy sector (smart grid analytics at GridCOP) and aerospace (drone diagnostics at Freefly). In both cases, I partnered with domain experts to understand their specific processes and challenges, then designed AI-native solutions tailored to their needs. For GridCOP, it was automating complex analytics tasks for power grid analysts. For Freefly, it was intelligent log analysis for aerospace engineers. This experience taught me how to quickly learn domain-specific requirements and translate them into operational AI systems."

**For "Production deployment and cloud-native engineering":**
> "I've deployed production AI-native systems on AWS with cloud-native practices including Docker containerization, microservices architecture, event-driven pipelines, and CI/CD automation. At GridCOP, we built infrastructure monitoring and observability from day one. At Freefly, we served 200+ daily users with comprehensive monitoring and quality metrics. I'm experienced with the full production lifecycle - not just building POCs, but operating reliable systems at scale."
