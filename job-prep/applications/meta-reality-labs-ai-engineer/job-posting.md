## Interview Talking Points

### **On Agentic Testing Frameworks:**
> "At GridCOP, I built a multi-agent system that autonomously assesses data quality and identifies edge cases in grid analytics. The system uses specialized agents coordinating through MCP to proactively surface issues before they reach analysts. This is similar to the agentic testing framework you're building - autonomous systems that identify quality issues and edge cases."

### **On Fine-tuning AI Models:**
> "At Freefly, I fine-tuned Llama 3.2-3B on drone telemetry data using LoRA because the base model struggled with domain-specific failure modes. I designed experiments comparing base vs fine-tuned performance, achieving 18% improvement in diagnostic accuracy. For Reality Labs, I'd apply the same approach - fine-tuning models on product-specific failure patterns to improve testing accuracy."

### **On Quality Metrics & Evaluation:**
> "I'm passionate about measuring AI quality in production. At GridCOP, I implemented deepeval to track context precision (0.85+) and LangSmith tracing to monitor agent decision quality. For Freefly, I built evaluation pipelines with human-in-the-loop validation. For Reality Labs testing, I'd establish similar metrics to measure testing effectiveness and drive continuous improvement."

### **On Context Engineering:**
> "Context engineering is critical for agentic AI quality. At GridCOP, I designed prompt strategies that give agents the right context about grid operations to make accurate decisions. For testing frameworks, context engineering would mean giving test agents the right domain knowledge about AR/VR systems to identify meaningful quality issues."

### **On Collaborating with ML Experts:**
> "At GridCOP, I worked closely with grid analysts - domain experts who understood power systems but needed AI solutions. I translated their quality requirements into technical implementations. Working with ML research scientists would follow a similar pattern - understanding research goals and building the engineering infrastructure to support experiments and productionize insights."
