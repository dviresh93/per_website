# Resume Validation Checklist

**USE THIS EVERY TIME BEFORE GENERATING PDF**

## Critical Rules - NEVER Violate These

### 1. LOCKED Bullets - Must Match Exactly

**Freefly Systems (4 bullets total):**
- ✅ Bullet 1: CUSTOMIZABLE for role (AI tool emphasis)
- ✅ Bullet 2: "Contributed to drone platform codebases implementing new features and optimizations for flight control systems and payload integration across multiple product lines, managed software integration projects from planning through release"
- ✅ Bullet 3: "Led release management for drone platforms overseeing testing phases from alpha through production deployment, coordinating firmware updates and executing comprehensive testing protocols with cross-functional teams"
- ✅ Bullet 4: "Built automated systems to process complex technical data and identify system failures, developing knowledge base enhancements and support tools that streamlined operations"

**Lumenier (2 bullets total - BOTH LOCKED):**
- ✅ Bullet 1: "Wrote embedded code in C++ to integrate LiDAR and optical flow sensors for obstacle avoidance and position holding with/without GPS under various lighting conditions"
- ✅ Bullet 2: "Collaborated with open-source flight control software maintainers for integration, testing, and deployment of autonomous flight algorithms, prototyped innovative features like toss-to-launch for product roadmap development"

**York Exponential (2 bullets total - BOTH LOCKED):**
- ✅ Bullet 1: "Developed prototype software for in-house autonomous surveillance mobile robots using ROS2, SLAM, and computer vision technologies"
- ✅ Bullet 2: "Built Human Machine Interface for Universal Robot welding applications using Python and Kivy framework, implemented multi-robot control systems with platform independence"

**WHY THESE ARE LOCKED:**
- Match LinkedIn exactly (credibility check)
- Show career progression and breadth
- Cannot be changed without LinkedIn inconsistency

### 2. Job Titles - Must Match Exactly

- Grid CoOperator: "AI Engineer" (NOT "Senior AI Engineer")
- Freefly Systems: "Senior Software Engineer" (NOT "AI Engineer")
- Lumenier: "Drone Software Developer" (NOT "Software Engineer - Embedded Systems")
- York Exponential: "Software Engineer - R&D"

### 3. Bullet Count Structure

**Required structure: 3-4-2-2**
- Grid CoOperator: 3 bullets (all customizable for role)
- Freefly: 4 bullets (1 customizable + 3 LOCKED)
- Lumenier: 2 bullets (both LOCKED)
- York: 2 bullets (both LOCKED)

**Total: 11 work bullets**

### 4. No Keyword Stuffing

❌ BAD: "Deep expertise in similarity search (FAISS, Pinecone)"
✅ GOOD: "Deep expertise in similarity search"

Technologies appear naturally in:
- Skills section (comprehensive list)
- Work bullets (where actually used)
- Projects (specific implementations)

## Pre-Generation Checklist

Before generating PDF, verify:

### Work Experience
- [ ] Grid CoOperator: 3 bullets
- [ ] Freefly: 4 bullets (check bullets 2-4 match LOCKED text exactly)
- [ ] Lumenier: 2 bullets (check both match LOCKED text exactly)
- [ ] York: 2 bullets (check both match LOCKED text exactly)
- [ ] Job titles match exactly (especially Lumenier = "Drone Software Developer")

### Dates
- [ ] Grid CoOperator: Mar 2025 - Present
- [ ] Freefly: Nov 2021 - Oct 2025
- [ ] Lumenier: Jul 2020 - Oct 2021
- [ ] York: Aug 2018 - May 2020

### Summary
- [ ] No parenthetical keyword examples like "(FAISS, Pinecone)"
- [ ] Reads naturally, not AI-generated
- [ ] 2-3 sentences max

### Skills
- [ ] Reordered to match job requirements
- [ ] No placeholders like "[CUSTOMIZE: ...]"

### Projects
- [ ] 3 projects selected
- [ ] Problem/Solution/Impact format
- [ ] Keywords listed naturally

## Source Files to Reference

**PRIMARY SOURCE (use this first):**
- `_resources/baseline-resume-data.json` - Your actual work history with LOCKED bullets

**TEMPLATE (only for structure):**
- `_template/resume-data.json` - Generic template, bullets need to be replaced with baseline

**WORKFLOW:**
1. Copy _template/ to new application folder
2. **IMMEDIATELY replace work bullets with bullets from baseline-resume-data.json**
3. Then customize only what's allowed (Grid bullets, Freefly bullet 1, summary, skills order)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Using generic template bullets instead of baseline LOCKED bullets
2. ❌ Changing Lumenier or York bullets (they're 100% LOCKED)
3. ❌ Changing Freefly bullets 2-4 (they're LOCKED)
4. ❌ Wrong job title for Lumenier (must be "Drone Software Developer")
5. ❌ Adding keyword examples in parentheses in summary
6. ❌ Wrong bullet count (must be 3-4-2-2)

## If You Made Changes to LOCKED Bullets

**STOP. Revert immediately.**

The LOCKED bullets exist to:
- Match LinkedIn (credibility)
- Show career progression
- Maintain consistency across all applications

Changing them breaks the system.
