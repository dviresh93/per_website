# Baseline Resume Format Rules

**Purpose:** Format rules and guidelines for resume generation. Load this file for structural guidance.

**Source:** Extracted from baseline-resume-data.json metadata (2025-11-04)

## Critical Workflow

**ALWAYS use baseline-resume-data.json as source of truth. NEVER use template bullets. Template has placeholders - baseline has real bullets.**

---

## Format Rules

### Work Experience Pattern
- **Grid CoOperator:** 3 bullets
- **Freefly Systems:** 4 bullets (1 customizable + 3 locked)
- **Lumenier:** 2 bullets (both locked)
- **York Exponential:** 2 bullets (both locked)

**Pattern:** 3-4-2-2

### Project Section
- **Count:** 3 projects per resume
- **Format:** Problem/Solution/Impact structure
- **Selection:** Choose most relevant to job posting

### Date Format
- **Pattern:** MM/YYYY
- **Example:** Mar 2025, Nov 2021

### Static Sections
- **Always include:** Lumenier, York Exponential, Education
- **Never omit** these sections (show career progression and foundation)

---

## Locked Content Rules

### Freefly Systems
- **Bullet 1:** CUSTOMIZABLE (choose variation based on role)
  - AI Engineer variation: GenAI-powered agent for log analysis
  - Software/Product Engineer variation: Diagnostic tools
- **Bullets 2-4:** LOCKED - Never modify
  - Match LinkedIn exactly
  - Show career progression

### Lumenier
- **Both bullets:** LOCKED - Never modify
  - Shows embedded/robotics credibility
  - Matches LinkedIn exactly
  - Technical details (C++, LiDAR, sensors)

### York Exponential
- **Both bullets:** LOCKED - Never modify
  - Shows robotics foundation
  - Matches LinkedIn exactly
  - Breadth (autonomous robots + HMI)

### Job Titles (LOCKED)
- **Grid CoOperator:** "AI Engineer"
- **Freefly Systems:** "Senior Software Engineer"
- **Lumenier:** "Drone Software Developer"
- **York Exponential:** "Software Engineer - R&D"

**Never change job titles** - they match LinkedIn and official records.

## Summary Customization Guidelines

**Base template:**
"AI Engineer specializing in multi-agent systems and AI orchestration, with 5+ years developing production GenAI solutions through rapid prototyping, iteration, and context engineering. Led cross-functional teams in deploying AI agents that improved efficiency by 50-80% within 3 months, establishing MLOps pipelines and evaluation frameworks for scalable AI solutions on AWS/Azure."

**Customize:**
- Replace "AI Engineer" with target role
- Adjust "multi-agent systems and AI orchestration" to match role focus
- Keep metrics (50-80%, 3 months) - they're proven
- Keep technical buzzwords aligned with job posting
