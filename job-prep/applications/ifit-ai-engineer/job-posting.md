# iFIT - AI Engineer

## Job Requirements

**Company Vision:**
iFIT's vision is to create the world's most holistic health and fitness platform, integrating all elements of health - physical fitness, mental health, nutrition and active recovery - into a seamless interactive experience.

**Core Requirements:**
- 5+ years of relevant engineering and AI experience
- **Experience with Agentic AI frameworks (LangGraph and Llama-Index)** - ESSENTIAL
- **Building, deploying and maintaining LLM-based agentic applications in production** - ESSENTIAL
- Demonstrated expertise in production-level Python/TypeScript code
- Proven ability to design and prototype AI solutions quickly
- **Experience with production-level multi-agent AI systems** - MUST HAVE
- Authorized to work in the United States without sponsorship

**Nice to Have:**
- Experience in consumer-facing AI products
- Background in health/fitness tech
- Experience with MLOps and evaluation frameworks
- Cross-functional team leadership
- Mentorship experience

**Technologies:**
- LangGraph
- Llama-Index
- LangChain (implied)
- Python (production-level)
- TypeScript (production-level)
- Multi-agent systems
- LLM APIs
- AWS/Cloud infrastructure
- MLOps tools

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Design, develop, and deploy AI Coach capabilities
- Collaborate with cross-functional team to ship production-quality code
- Build systems that enable evals and application observability
- Contribute to architectural decisions and best practices
- Improve foundational LLMs
- Monitor and adopt new AI/ML developments
- Provide mentorship and guidance on AI best practices

## Fit Assessment (90%)

**Strengths:**
- **Multi-agent systems expertise:** Built GridCOP using LangGraph and LangChain orchestration
- **Production AI deployment:** 2+ years deploying LLM-based applications (GridCOP, Freefly AI Tool)
- **Production-level Python/TypeScript:** 5+ years experience in both languages
- **Rapid prototyping:** Proven track record (70% efficiency gains in 2 months at GridCOP)
- **Evals & observability:** Built model evaluation pipelines, monitoring, cost tracking
- **Cross-functional collaboration:** Led cross-functional teams at GridCOP and Freefly
- **Production quality code:** Systems serving 50-200 daily queries with monitoring
- **Agentic AI frameworks:** Direct experience with LangGraph, LangChain, MCP

**Gaps:**
- **Llama-Index:** No direct experience, but extensive LangChain knowledge is transferable
- **Consumer-facing AI:** More B2B/enterprise focus, but have built user-facing tools
- **Health/Fitness domain:** No direct experience, but proven ability to learn domains quickly (embedded → AI transition)

**Overall Assessment:**
Excellent fit. All core requirements align perfectly with experience in multi-agent systems, production AI deployment, and rapid prototyping. The role's emphasis on LangGraph, production multi-agent systems, and evals/observability directly matches GridCOP and Freefly work.
