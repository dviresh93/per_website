**Role:** Senior AI Engineer
**Location:** Fully Remote - USA
**Compensation:** $180,000 - $220,000 base + bonus
**Date Posted:** 2025-11-04
**Application Status:** researching
**Fit Score:** 90%

## Job Description

### Overview
Fast-growing SaaS marketplace recently acquired by major PE firm focused on transforming data-rich platforms into AI-first businesses. The data foundation exists; need to build the intelligence layer for matching, recommendations, and automation serving thousands of users.

### Key Details
- **Not a research role** - Production systems that real customers use daily
- **Focus areas:** Matching, recommendations, document understanding, retrieval, automation
- **Scale:** Thousands of users, trusted platform with real data
- **Stage:** Post-acquisition, AI-first transformation

### Responsibilities
- Take ownership of existing matching and recommendation models and improve them
- Build RAG and document-understanding features for long, messy real-world data
- Design and deliver AI workflows that get used (not just prototyped)
- Set up AI engineering practices: CI/CD, evaluations, guardrails, cost management
- Collaborate with engineering, product, and data teams

### Requirements
- Experience shipping production AI or ML systems
- Strong software engineering skills with cloud, CI/CD, and microservices
- Understanding of both machine learning and LLM approaches and when to use each
- Comfort with retrieval, RAG pipelines, and safety considerations in production
- Curiosity, judgment, and results-first mindset

## Fit Assessment

### Strengths (Perfect Matches)

**Production AI Systems:**
- GridCOP: Multi-agent system in production serving 50-100 daily queries
- Freefly Tool: 200+ daily users, production deployment with monitoring
- 6 weeks to production, 70% efficiency gains in 2 months = fast delivery

**RAG & Document Understanding:**
- Built RAG pipelines with LangGraph, LangChain, FAISS
- Automated log analysis = document understanding for messy, unstructured data
- Real-world data processing (drone logs, grid analytics)

**Matching & Recommendations:**
- Multi-agent orchestration = intelligent routing/matching capability
- Specialized agents coordinating complex tasks = recommendation logic

**Software Engineering Rigor:**
- CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, observability in production
- AWS deployment, cost optimization
- Evaluation frameworks, model governance

**Both ML and LLM Approaches:**
- Classical ML background: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
- Modern LLM experience: LangGraph, LangChain, foundation model APIs
- Judgment on when to use each approach

**Results-First Mindset:**
- "This is not research or demo role" = your exact profile
- Ship features that get used: 70% analyst productivity gains, 200+ daily users
- Rapid prototyping to production (6 weeks)

### Potential Concerns

**Title: Senior AI Engineer**
- You have 5+ years building production AI systems
- Led architecture decisions (GridCOP multi-agent design)
- Cross-functional leadership, mentorship mentioned in skills
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize leadership/ownership in resume summary

**Marketplace Domain (New)**
- You've worked in: Robotics → Smart Grid → Drone systems
- Strong track record of domain adaptation
- **Mitigation:** Lead with "domain-switching ability" narrative, show how you learn industry-specific challenges quickly

**Scale: "Thousands of users"**
- Your experience: 50-100 daily queries (GridCOP), 200+ daily users (Freefly)
- Both production systems with real usage
- **Mitigation:** This is real scale, just emphasize production readiness and ability to design for scale

### Gaps (Minor)

None significant. This role is an excellent match for your profile.

## Resume Customization Strategy

### Summary Customization
**Focus:** Production AI systems + RAG + document understanding + both ML/LLM approaches

**Key Messages:**
1. "Senior AI Engineer with 5+ years shipping production AI systems" (title match)
2. "RAG pipelines and document understanding for messy, real-world data" (core requirement)
3. "Both classical ML and modern LLM approaches" (key differentiator)
4. "Results-first mindset: 70-80% efficiency gains through production deployment" (their language)
5. "Strong software engineering: CI/CD, monitoring, cost optimization" (engineering rigor)

### Skills Reordering
**Priority order:**
1. AI/ML Frameworks (RAG, LangGraph, LangChain, Model Evaluation first)
2. Programming (Python, TypeScript, SQL)
3. Cloud & Infrastructure (AWS, CI/CD, Monitoring)
4. Product & Collaboration (Cross-functional Leadership)

### Work Experience Highlights
**Grid CoOperator (All 3 bullets):**
- Multi-agent = matching/recommendation capability
- RAG and evaluation frameworks
- Production deployment with monitoring

**Freefly (Customize bullet 1):**
- Emphasize document understanding (log analysis)
- Production system serving 200+ daily users
- Evaluation frameworks and model governance

**Keep Lumenier and York (LOCKED):**
- Shows software engineering depth and breadth

### Projects Selection
1. **GridCOP** - Multi-agent, RAG, production deployment (PERFECT match)
2. **Production System Optimization Tool** - Document understanding (logs), 200+ users
3. **AI Travel Planner** - RAG, real-world data integration

### Keywords to Include
- Production AI systems
- RAG pipelines
- Document understanding
- Matching and recommendations
- Both ML and LLM approaches
- CI/CD for AI
- Model evaluation
- Cost optimization
- Microservices
- Results-first

## Application Strategy

### Timeline
- **Today:** Submit application with tailored resume
- **Day 1-2:** Research company (find PE firm, marketplace domain)
- **Day 3-7:** Network on LinkedIn (find AI engineers, engineering managers)
- **Week 2:** Follow-up if no response

### Networking Approach
Since company name is not disclosed:
1. Wait for recruiter contact to identify company
2. Then research employees on LinkedIn
3. Connect with AI/ML engineers in marketplace/SaaS domains

### Interview Preparation Focus
1. **Production AI systems:** Be ready to discuss GridCOP architecture, deployment, monitoring
2. **RAG deep dive:** FAISS setup, chunking strategies, retrieval quality
3. **Document understanding:** Log analysis system, handling messy data
4. **ML vs LLM judgment:** When to use classical ML vs LLMs, trade-offs
5. **Cost optimization:** How you've managed LLM costs in production
6. **Marketplace domain:** Research common challenges (matching quality, recommendations, fraud)

### Questions to Ask
1. What's the current state of the matching/recommendation models?
2. What does the data foundation look like? (structured vs unstructured)
3. How mature is the AI engineering practice? (CI/CD, monitoring, etc.)
4. What's the biggest AI challenge you're facing right now?
5. How does the PE firm's AI-first vision translate to product roadmap?
6. What does success look like in the first 6 months?

## Why This Role is Compelling

**Strengths:**
- Production-first focus (no research theater)
- Real data and users (not starting from scratch)
- Clear technical challenges (RAG, matching, document understanding)
- End-to-end ownership (CI/CD, evaluations, cost management)
- Post-acquisition momentum (resources, urgency)

**Potential Concerns:**
- Company name not disclosed (wait for recruiter)
- PE-backed transformation = potential pressure/timeline expectations
- "Occasional travel" (likely fine for you)

**Overall:** This is a high-fit role with real impact potential. The focus on production systems, RAG, and engineering rigor aligns perfectly with your strengths.
