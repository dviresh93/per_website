# Paradigm - Applied AI Engineer

## Company Overview
Paradigm is a software company transforming the way that the residential construction & building product industries operate across the globe. They're looking for an Applied AI Engineer to revolutionize these industries by building AI systems that power next-generation construction workflows.

## Role Focus
Design and deploy AI systems that automate key steps in homebuilding: plan interpretation, takeoffs, estimating, and specification matching. Bridge between ML models and real-world applications using LLMs, computer vision, retrieval systems, and agentic orchestration.

## Job Requirements

**Core Requirements:**
- **5+ years** designing, building, and deploying AI/ML-powered systems in production
- **Recent hands-on work with LLMs or agentic architectures** - CRITICAL
- **LLMs, RAG pipelines, multimodal models** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face) - ESSENTIAL
- **Python + major ML framework** (PyTorch, TensorFlow) - REQUIRED
- **Agentic orchestration frameworks** (LangGraph, Temporal, n8n) - CRITICAL
- **Enterprise AI platforms** (Azure AI Foundry, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI)
- **Retrieval systems, vector databases, semantic search** for contextual grounding
- **Prompt engineering, model evaluation, cost/performance optimization**
- Excellent problem-solving skills, curiosity, collaborative mindset

**Nice to Have:**
- Exposure to construction or design automation workflows
- Experience with plan files, CAD/BIM data, or digital twin systems
- Evaluation-driven AI development (zero/few-shot testing, Chain-of-Thought, LLM-as-a-judge)
- Data labeling, feedback loops, fine-tuning for domain-specific accuracy
- Agent performance metrics and lifecycle management across production environments

**Technologies:**
- LangGraph, LangChain (agentic orchestration)
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face (LLMs)
- PyTorch, TensorFlow (ML frameworks)
- Vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone)
- Azure AI Foundry, AWS Bedrock, Google Vertex AI
- CAD/BIM data, multimodal datasets

## Fit Assessment (85%)

**Strengths:**
- **Agentic AI Systems:** GridCOP - multi-agent with LangGraph/LangChain (EXACT match to critical requirement)
- **RAG Pipelines:** GridCOP & Freefly - RAG + vector search (FAISS) in production
- **LLM Experience:** Foundation model APIs (Ollama, Llama 3.2, Claude) in production
- **Production Deployment:** AWS, 50-200 daily queries, monitoring, observability
- **Model Evaluation:** Built evaluation frameworks, cost monitoring, HIL validation
- **Python + ML:** 5+ years Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow experience
- **Vector Databases:** FAISS, Pinecone implementation experience
- **Prompt Engineering:** Production prompt engineering with iterative optimization

**Gaps:**
- **Construction/CAD/BIM Domain:** No direct experience, but proven domain-switching ability (robotics → AI)
- **Fine-tuning:** Prompt engineering & RAG experience, but not fine-tuning specifically
- **Specific Enterprise Platforms:** AWS deployment, but not Azure AI Foundry or AWS Bedrock specifically

**Overall Assessment:**
Excellent technical fit (85%). All core AI engineering requirements met perfectly - LangGraph, RAG, production agentic systems, evaluation frameworks. Main gap is construction domain knowledge, but proven track record of learning complex technical domains (successfully transitioned robotics → AI). The role is essentially building production agentic AI with LLMs/RAG for construction workflows, which matches GridCOP experience exactly (just different domain).
