**Application Date:** 2025-11-13
**Status:** Draft
**Fit Score:** 75-80%

## Job Details

**Company:** Rippling
**Location:** San Francisco, CA
**Type:** Full-time
**Domain:** HR/IT/Finance SaaS Platform

## Company Overview

Rippling gives businesses one place to run HR, IT, and Finance. It brings together all of the workforce systems that are normally scattered across a company, like payroll, expenses, benefits, and computers. For the first time ever, you can manage and automate every part of the employee lifecycle in a single system.

**Funding:** $1.4B+ from Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, Sequoia, Greenoaks, Bedrock
**Recognition:** Forbes America's best startup employers

## Role Description

We use machine learning and large language models to build software which helps our internal GTM teams operate their business effectively. This manifests as either features inside of existing Rippling products or new products. In this role, you'll play the role of a backend engineer working across the stack (backend services, data pipelines, APIs) and will even have the opportunity to contribute to more ML specific tasks.

**Products Built:**
- **Monitor** - Proactive deal risks and insights
- **Plays** - Run sales strategies
- **Research** - Scale your research
- **Outreach** - Launch automated campaigns

## Requirements

### Hard Requirements
- ✅ 6+ years industry experience building software (I have ~7 years: Aug 2018 - Present)
- ✅ Experience developing user-facing applications (GridCOP, diagnostic tool with React)
- ❌ Experience in Ads/Personalization/Sales domain (NO direct experience)
- ✅ Interest/experience in agentic AI and LLM use cases (GridCOP multi-agent, diagnostic tool)
- ✅ Hands-on programming (Python, C++, JavaScript/TypeScript)
- ✅ Communicate complex technical ideas (evidenced throughout resume)

### Responsibilities
- Design, develop, code and test backend software systems
- Ensure operational excellence and scale data platform capabilities
- Work with other teams to build AI & data-driven GTM products
- Monitor, Plays, Research, Outreach features

## Fit Analysis

### Strengths
✅ **Agentic AI expertise** - GridCOP multi-agent system directly relevant
✅ **LLM integration** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Llama
✅ **Backend + ML hybrid** - Exactly what they want
✅ **Production AI systems** - Shipped to 200+ users, not just prototypes
✅ **User-facing applications** - React + Flask full-stack experience
✅ **Data pipelines** - GridCOP data processing, SQL databases

### Gaps
❌ **No Ads/Personalization/Sales domain experience** - My work is smart grid analytics and drone diagnostics
⚠️ **Data platform scale** - I have data processing, but not "scale data platform" level
⚠️ **GTM products** - No experience building sales/marketing tools

### Positioning Strategy
- Lead with **backend engineer who does AI/ML**, not "AI engineer who does backend"
- Emphasize **production systems, scalability, operational excellence**
- Highlight **agentic AI and LLM integration** as differentiator
- Show **full-stack capability** (React + Flask + data pipelines)
- Acknowledge domain gap, but demonstrate technical transferability

## Customization Notes

### Summary
- Repositioned as "Software Engineer" not "AI Engineer"
- Emphasized backend systems, data pipelines, APIs first
- Kept AI/ML as enhancement, not primary focus
- Added "operational excellence" language (matches their requirements)

### Work Experience
- **Grid CoOperator:** Already perfect - backend service, APIs, data processing
- **Freefly bullet 1:** NEW variation emphasizing full-stack backend + LLM integration + data pipelines
- **Locked bullets 2-4:** No changes (match LinkedIn)

### Skills
- **Reordered sections:**
  1. Programming & Backend (was just "Programming")
  2. Cloud & Infrastructure (added "Data Pipelines", "Backend Services", "Operational Excellence")
  3. AI/ML & LLMs (was second, now third - still comprehensive)
  4. Data & Analytics (unchanged)

### Projects
- **GridCOP** - Perfect for agentic AI requirement
- **Production System Optimization Tool** - Shows full-stack backend + production deployment
- **AI Travel Planner** - Shows breadth, API integration

## Notes

**Why this role:**
- Backend + AI hybrid perfectly matches my transition
- Agentic AI and LLM work directly applicable
- Production focus aligns with my experience
- San Francisco location (willing to relocate/remote?)

**Concerns:**
- Domain gap (no sales/GTM experience) - address in cover letter by emphasizing technical transferability
- 6+ years is minimum, I'm at 7 years - on the edge
- Data platform scale might be beyond my current experience level

**Interview Prep:**
- Prepare examples of backend systems design
- Be ready to discuss data pipeline architecture
- Explain how agentic AI could apply to sales/GTM use cases
- Research Rippling's GTM products (Monitor, Plays, Research, Outreach)
