## Fit Assessment (88%)

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Strong RAG experience (Drone Log Analysis Tool - production RAG system)
- ✅ Agentic AI expertise (GridCOP - multi-agent coordination system)
- ✅ LangChain framework experience (hands-on with LangGraph, LangSmith)
- ✅ Vector databases & similarity search (ChromaDB, FAISS implementation)
- ✅ Prompt engineering & LLM integration (GPT-4, Claude integration)
- ✅ End-to-end AI development (preprocessing → deployment → monitoring)
- ✅ Python ML stack (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy)
- ✅ Real-world deployment experience (production systems at Freefly, GridCOP)
- ✅ Cross-functional collaboration (worked with engineering, product teams)
- ✅ Bachelor's in Computer Engineering (meets requirement)

**Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Finance domain experience (minor - position as transferable skills from robotics/embedded)
- ⚠️ Table transformers (minor - quick learner, strong ML foundation)
- ⚠️ Formal Data Science degree (have CE + strong practical GenAI experience)
- ⚠️ Cloud certifications (have practical AWS/GCP experience, emphasize this)

**Overall Assessment:**
Excellent fit (88%) - strong alignment on core GenAI requirements (RAG, agentic AI, LangChain, LLM integration). Practical production experience with RAG systems and multi-agent coordination directly matches role needs. Lack of finance domain experience is minor compared to strong technical foundation and proven ability to build end-to-end GenAI solutions.
