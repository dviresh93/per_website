## Company: Broccoli AI

**About:**
At Broccoli AI, we're building AI voice agents that act like real employees — answering phones 24/7, booking jobs in ServiceTitan, alerting techs when emergencies hit, and following up on missed calls or open estimates.

In just 12 months, we've grown to 200+ contractors with 40% MoM growth. Backed by top-tier VCs, we're building the AI-native operating system for the trades — helping home service businesses run faster, smarter, and around the clock.

We're not just shipping software; we're redefining how small businesses interact with technology.

## Role: Product Engineer

### What You'll Do

As a Product Engineer at Broccoli AI, you'll build and own real products from concept to production. That means:

- Talking to users and understanding how our agents make their lives easier
- Designing, building, and iterating on features that make our AI employees more capable every week
- Owning the full lifecycle — from brainstorming to deployment to post-launch learning
- Building real-time systems that interact with customers through natural language
- Testing MVPs in production with real users and learning fast
- Collaborating across engineering, product, and growth to shape the roadmap

You'll work in a fast-paced, high-ownership environment where autonomy, creativity, and execution matter more than titles or process.

### What We're Looking For

- You're a builder. You love taking ideas from zero to one and seeing them come to life with users.
- 1+ year of experience as a software engineer (backend, frontend, or full-stack).
- You're comfortable owning end-to-end product experiences — from UX decisions to API design to shipping reliable systems.
- You think like a product owner, not just a coder. You care deeply about what users need and how your work impacts them.
- You love moving fast and shipping meaningful work every week.
- You're comfortable in ambiguity, but obsessed with clarity.
- You're excited about working in-office with other builders, iterating face-to-face, and shipping faster than anyone else.

**Bonus Points:**
- Experience with AI, LLMs, real-time communication systems, or telephony
- Familiarity with Node.js, Python, or TypeScript
- Startup experience or evidence you thrive in small, high-output teams

### Why Broccoli AI

- **Massive Impact:** You'll be part of a small team building the core systems that power thousands of real customer interactions daily.
- **Speed + Autonomy:** We ship in weeks, not quarters — and you'll directly own outcomes, not just tickets.
- **Learn from the Best:** Collaborate with repeat founders and top engineers shaping the future of AI in the real world.
- **Beautiful Office:** Based in South Park, San Francisco — surrounded by builders, founders, and creators.
- **Top-of-Market Compensation + Equity:** We invest in our people
