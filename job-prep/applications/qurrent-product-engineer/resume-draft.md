## PROJECTS

### GridCOP: Smart Grid Analytics Agent | **Grid CoOperator**

- **Problem:** Power grid analysts needed automated database querying and intelligent insights to understand complex data patterns beyond basic visualizations

- **Solution:** Developed A2A multi-agent system using LangChain orchestration and MCP where specialized agents coordinate tasks through prompt engineering strategies, implemented RAG and vector search (FAISS) for intelligent querying, implemented model evaluation frameworks to monitor quality and cost metrics, deployed on AWS with observability and logging

- **Impact:** Enhanced analyst productivity by 70% through AI co-pilot that augments domain experts with automated workflows, implemented human-in-the-loop (HIL) evaluation and testing pipelines for production-ready AI systems with robust error handling through rapid iteration

---

### Production System Optimization Tool | **Freefly Systems**

- **Problem:** Manual system analysis taking hours of expert time, creating bottlenecks in product development and customer support resolution

- **Solution:** Built full-stack application with React frontend, Python Flask backend, integrated foundation model APIs (Ollama and Llama 3.2) for real-time log processing and interactive analysis using prompt engineering and model evaluation

- **Impact:** Transformed expert analysis from hours to minutes, deployed to production serving 200+ daily queries with significant performance improvements through rapid iteration and continuous optimization

---

### AI Travel Planner Agent | **Personal**

- **Problem:** Manual travel planning requiring hours of research across multiple sources with inconsistent and outdated information

- **Solution:** Built AI agent using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, LangChain, Streamlit, and DuckDuckGo Search API for personalized itinerary generation using prompt engineering techniques

- **Impact:** Demonstrated end-to-end AI application development, learned conversational AI patterns and real-time data integration techniques through iterative development
