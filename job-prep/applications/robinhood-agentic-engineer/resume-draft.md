## NOTES FOR PDF GENERATION

**Emphasis for Robinhood Agentic Team role:**
1. Agent platform building (tooling for teams to build/evaluate/deploy agents)
2. Rapid prototyping support (intuitive workflows, developer-friendly)
3. Agent evaluation (automated testing, quality gates)
4. Production-grade infrastructure (AWS, Docker, scalable)
5. Governance & observability (monitoring by default, error tracking)
6. Multi-agent architecture (LangChain, MCP, RAG patterns)
7. Continuous optimization (bias toward action, iterative improvements)
8. Cross-functional collaboration (partnering with teams, surfacing pain points)

**Perfect alignment:**

- ✅ Building agents with LLMs (GridCOP, Freefly)
- ✅ Multi-agent architecture (GridCOP with MCP)
- ✅ RAG patterns (both projects)
- ✅ Prompt engineering (extensive experience)
- ✅ Python proficiency (primary language)
- ✅ Platform/tooling mindset (built platforms for internal teams)
- ✅ Evaluation focus (quality gates, automated testing)
- ✅ Scalable infrastructure (AWS, Docker)
- ✅ Collaborative approach (partnered with analysts, engineers)

**Nice-to-haves:**
- ✅ C++ proficiency (Lumenier, York work)
- ⚠️ Frontend (React yes, TypeScript learning)

**REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Check if summary emphasizes agent platform building and tooling
2. Verify Grid CoOperator positioned as agent platform (not just agent system)
3. Verify Freefly shows internal platform for engineering teams
4. Confirm skills section highlights multi-agent, RAG, evaluation, platform development
5. Ensure projects show platform approach with governance/observability
6. Check if overall narrative positions you as platform builder who enables others to build agents

**Once approved, I'll generate PDF with template #1**
