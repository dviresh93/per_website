## Fit Assessment (90%)

**Strengths:**
- **TypeScript + Python Production:** Built TypeScript/React + Python Flask production AI tool (Freefly - 200+ daily users) - EXACT stack match
- **AI Agent Systems:** Architected multi-agent system with LangGraph/LangChain (GridCOP) - directly applicable to agent training platform
- **Conversational AI Understanding:** LLM integration, prompt engineering, foundation model APIs in production
- **Unstructured Data Insights:** Built log analysis tool extracting actionable insights from complex technical data (perfect parallel to conversational data)
- **Production Monitoring:** Observability systems, error handling, automation across production AI deployments
- **End-to-End Ownership:** GridCOP (concept to production in 6 weeks), Freefly tool (full-stack AI application)
- **Async Programming:** Production distributed systems, real-time processing, AWS deployment
- **System Debugging:** Deep troubleshooting across complex stacks (embedded systems, cloud infrastructure, AI pipelines)
- **Rapid Execution:** 70% efficiency gains in 2 months - perfect for "relentless momentum" culture
- **Full-Stack Capability:** React frontend + Python backend + AI integration (exactly what agent platform needs)
- **Scalability Focus:** Built systems handling production scale with monitoring and optimization

**Gaps:**
- **Multi-modal models:** Limited experience (nice-to-have, not required)
- **CX domain:** No direct customer experience platform experience (but have product engineering + AI)

**Overall Assessment:**
Exceptional fit (90%). You have the exact technical foundation: TypeScript + Python production experience, AI agent development, unstructured data extraction, monitoring/automation, and end-to-end ownership. The role is building a platform for training AI agents - you've built AI agent systems. They extract insights from conversational data - you extract insights from log data (same skills). Decagon needs fast-moving engineers who own products end-to-end in a high-growth environment, which matches your GridCOP and Freefly experience perfectly. The TypeScript/React + Python stack from your Freefly tool is exactly what they need.
