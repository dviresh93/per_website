### Potential Concerns

**Foundation Model Training:**
- Your experience is primarily inference, not training large models at scale
- **Mitigation:** You have strong ML fundamentals (PyTorch, TensorFlow), can learn training quickly
- Emphasize: "Expertise enables seeing optimization opportunities others miss"

**Huggingface/AWS Ultraclusters:**
- Not explicitly mentioned in your resume
- **Mitigation:** Strong AWS experience, open-source framework experience
- These are tools, not fundamental skills

**Go/Scala/Java:**
- You have Python, C++, TypeScript, JavaScript
- No Go, Scala, or Java explicitly listed
- **Mitigation:** "3+ years Python" requirement is met, other languages are nice-to-have
- C++ shows systems programming depth

**Scale: "Millions of customers":**
- Your systems: 50-100 queries (GridCOP), 200+ users (Freefly)
- Not yet "millions" scale
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize scalability design, cloud architecture, performance optimization
- Show ability to design for scale even if current systems are smaller

### Gaps (Minor)

**State-of-the-Art Research Application:**
- You stay current with frameworks (LangGraph, MCP)
- May need to show more depth in reading/applying research papers
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize rapid adoption of cutting-edge techniques, experimentation mindset
