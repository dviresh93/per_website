## Interview Talking Points

### **On LLMs & RAG:**
> "I've built two production RAG systems in the last 2 years. At GridCOP, I implemented RAG with FAISS vector search to help grid analysts query complex data - we achieved 0.85+ context precision using deepeval. At Freefly, I built an LLM diagnostic tool using Ollama and Llama 3.2 that serves 200+ queries daily. RAG is my core expertise - from vector embeddings to retrieval optimization to evaluation."

### **On Production ML Systems:**
> "Both of my recent AI systems are in production serving real users daily. GridCOP handles 50-100 queries daily for power grid analysts, and the Freefly diagnostic tool serves 200+ daily queries. I understand the difference between a demo and production - monitoring with LangSmith, evaluation with deepeval, error handling, and continuous optimization based on user feedback."

### **On AWS Deployment:**
> "I deployed GridCOP on AWS with a scalable backend architecture that handles real-time queries. I designed the API layer with FastAPI, set up observability for monitoring, and ensured reliable performance for operational decision support. I'm comfortable with AWS services for ML workloads and can architect systems that scale."

### **On Model Optimization:**
> "At Freefly, I fine-tuned Llama 3.2-3B using LoRA on domain-specific drone telemetry data, achieving 18% accuracy improvement. I used deepeval to measure RAG quality metrics - context precision, answer relevancy, faithfulness - and iteratively refined prompts when scores dropped. For GridCOP, I built a data pipeline to collect and annotate 500+ user queries for continuous model refinement."

### **On Cross-functional Collaboration:**
> "At Freefly, I led release management coordinating with cross-functional teams through alpha to production deployment. At GridCOP, I worked closely with grid analysts - domain experts who didn't know AI but knew power systems. I translated their operational needs into technical solutions, built tools they could actually use, and communicated progress in non-technical terms."
