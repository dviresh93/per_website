# AI Engineer Template - Pre-Optimized Resume ⚡

**Time Savings: 8-10 minutes per application (3-5 min total vs 12-15 min with baseline)**

This template is 90% ready for AI Engineer applications. It's pre-optimized with:
- ✓ Skills section ordered for AI/ML roles (LangGraph, LangChain, Multi-Agent Systems first)
- ✓ Work highlights emphasizing production AI, observability, rapid prototyping
- ✓ Best 3 projects selected (GridCOP, Production Tool, AI Travel Planner)
- ✓ Label set to "AI Engineer"
- ✓ Programming languages prioritized (Python, TypeScript first)

## Quick Start (3-5 minutes total)

```bash
# 1. Copy this template (30 sec)
cp -r _template-ai-engineer/ {company-role}/

# 2. Edit resume-data.json summary only (2 min)
# Just customize the summary to match job requirements
# Everything else is already optimized

# 3. Generate resume (instant)
# Use MCP resume generator tool

# Done!
```

## What to Customize

### Required (2 min)
**Summary** (`basics.summary`): Rewrite 2-3 sentences to match job focus
- Multi-agent systems? RAG? MLOps? Consumer AI?
- Keep structure, swap keywords
- Example: "AI Engineer with 5+ years building production multi-agent systems using LangGraph/LangChain. Proven track record deploying LLM-based applications at scale with evals, observability, and rapid prototyping that delivered 70-80% efficiency gains within 3 months. Led cross-functional teams establishing MLOps pipelines and evaluation frameworks for consumer-facing AI experiences on AWS."

### Optional (1-2 min)
1. **Work highlights**: Add 1-2 job-specific keywords if needed
2. **Project order**: Swap if another project is more relevant than GridCOP

## What's Already Optimized ✓

**Skills section**: AI/ML Frameworks first
- LangGraph, LangChain, Multi-Agent Systems leading
- Programming: Python, TypeScript prioritized
- Cloud: AWS, Production Deployment emphasized
- New category: Product & Collaboration (cross-functional, rapid prototyping)

**Work experience**: All highlights emphasize
- Production AI deployment
- Multi-agent systems (LangGraph/LangChain)
- Evals & observability
- TypeScript/Python
- Rapid prototyping
- Consumer-facing AI

**Projects**: Best 3 selected
- GridCOP (multi-agent, LangGraph, production)
- Production System Optimization Tool (full-stack AI, TypeScript/React)
- AI Travel Planner (LangChain agent)

## When to Use This Template

**Perfect for:**
- AI Engineer
- Multi-agent System Engineer
- LLM/GenAI Engineer
- Production AI Engineer
- MLOps Engineer
- AI Infrastructure Engineer

**Use baseline `_template/` instead for:**
- Robotics Engineer (emphasize embedded/ROS/PX4)
- Software Engineer (non-AI focus)
- Forward Deployed Engineer (emphasize cross-functional over AI)

## Time Comparison

| Task | Baseline Template | AI Engineer Template |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Edit summary | 2 min | 2 min |
| Reorder skills | 3 min | ✓ Done |
| Update work highlights | 4 min | ✓ Done (optional) |
| Select projects | 2 min | ✓ Done |
| Set label | 30 sec | ✓ Done |
| **Total** | **~12-15 min** | **~3-5 min** |

## Example: iFIT AI Engineer

For a role emphasizing multi-agent AI Coach:

```json
"summary": "AI Engineer with 5+ years building production multi-agent systems and AI orchestration using LangGraph, LangChain, and agentic AI frameworks. Proven track record deploying LLM-based applications at scale with evals, observability, and rapid prototyping that delivered 70-80% efficiency gains within 3 months. Led cross-functional teams establishing MLOps pipelines and evaluation frameworks for consumer-facing AI experiences on AWS."
```

That's it! Everything else already matches.

## Tips

- **If job emphasizes specific framework**: Add to summary (e.g., "Llama-Index", "CrewAI")
- **If job emphasizes domain**: Mention in summary (e.g., "health tech", "fintech")
- **If job emphasizes scale**: Use existing metrics (50-200 queries, 6 weeks to production)
- **If job emphasizes consumer products**: Already emphasized in Freefly highlights
