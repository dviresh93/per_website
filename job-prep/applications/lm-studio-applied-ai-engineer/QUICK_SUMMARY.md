# LM Studio - Applied AI Engineer Application

## Fit Score: 85%

### Perfect Matches:
✅ Agentic AI systems (GridCOP multi-agent with LangGraph)
✅ Python + C++ + TypeScript (all in production)
✅ Empirical/experimental mindset (built evaluation frameworks)
✅ Product-minded (200+ daily users, user feedback loops)
✅ Rapid prototyping to production (6 weeks, 70% gains in 2 months)
✅ Strong algorithms (CS Master's, production optimization)

### Gaps:
⚠️ On-device AI (mostly cloud-based AWS experience)
⚠️ MLX/M-chip optimization (no direct experience, but embedded systems background)

### Key Selling Points:
1. Lead agentic work → Built production multi-agent system (GridCOP)
2. Scientific method → Evaluation frameworks, ablation testing, metrics tracking
3. Practitioner first → "Serious software engineer who builds robust systems fast" = exact profile
4. Multi-language → Python (primary) + C++ (embedded) + TypeScript (production tools)
5. Product features immediately → Shipped production tools serving 200+ daily users

### Resume Strategy:
- Lead with GridCOP (agentic, evaluation, rapid iteration)
- Emphasize C++ background (embedded systems = performance-conscious)
- Highlight evaluation frameworks (scientific rigor)
- Show rapid prototyping to production (robust systems fast)
- De-emphasize cloud deployment, emphasize algorithms and optimization
