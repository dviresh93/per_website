# FurtherAI - AI Engineer (Agent Team)

## Company Overview
- Building AI agents for insurance industry
- Funding: $30M+ from a16z, YC, General Catalyst
- Team: 20-person, fast-growing startup
- Focus: B2B SaaS AI agents that augment insurance knowledge workers

## Role Focus
- **Agent Team:** Build multi-agent systems, evaluation frameworks, MCP orchestration
- **0-1 Building:** Concept to production, iterate fast
- **Prompt Engineering:** "Amazing ability to speak with LLMs"
- **Production AI:** Serve real customers, monitor quality and cost

## Key Requirements

### Must-Have
- Multi-agent systems (LangGraph/LangChain)
- Evaluation frameworks for AI systems
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) orchestration
- Prompt engineering and iteration
- 0-1 building experience
- B2B SaaS production AI

### Nice-to-Have
- Insurance domain knowledge (not required)
- React/TypeScript full stack
- AWS deployment

## Fit Assessment

**Fit Score: 93%**

This is an exceptional fit - 93%. You have production multi-agent experience with evaluation frameworks, MCP orchestration, 0-1 building, and B2B SaaS - exactly what they want with GridCOP.

### Strengths
✅ **Multi-agent systems:** GridCOP is A2A multi-agent system using LangChain/LangGraph orchestration
✅ **Evaluation frameworks:** Built model evaluation pipelines tracking quality, cost, latency for GridCOP
✅ **MCP orchestration:** Used MCP in GridCOP for specialized agent coordination
✅ **Prompt engineering:** Iterative prompt engineering strategies reduced workflows by 70% in 2 months
✅ **0-1 experience:** GridCOP concept to production in 6 weeks, Freefly tool from concept to 200+ daily users
✅ **B2B SaaS:** GridCOP serves business analysts, Freefly tool serves engineering teams
✅ **Production AI:** Serving 50-100 daily queries (GridCOP), 200+ daily queries (Freefly tool)
✅ **AWS deployment:** Deployed GridCOP on AWS with observability, logging, cost monitoring
✅ **Rapid iteration:** "Rapid iteration" appears 3 times in your work bullets - core strength

### Gaps
⚠️ **Insurance domain:** Zero experience - but they say "not required, we'll teach you"

### Why This Role
- Agent team focus = perfect match for GridCOP experience
- Evaluation frameworks = you built this for GridCOP
- MCP orchestration = you used this in GridCOP
- 0-1 building = GridCOP and Freefly tool both concept-to-production
- B2B SaaS = both your AI products serve business users
- "Amazing ability to speak with LLMs" = your iterative prompt engineering strength

## Resume Customization Strategy

### Summary Focus
Emphasize:
- Multi-agent systems and AI orchestration (GridCOP A2A architecture)
- Evaluation frameworks and monitoring (quality, cost, latency tracking)
- MCP orchestration for agent coordination
- 0-1 building experience (concept to production in weeks)
- B2B SaaS AI products serving real users
- Rapid iteration and prompt engineering
