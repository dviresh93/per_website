## Job Description

### What You'll Do
- Partner with Engineering teams to build efficient robotic software to support revolutionary Laser Weeding robots and future products
- Build and troubleshoot robot system software and develop tooling to support high performance robotics algorithms
- Deliver state of the art AI performance to robots by improving machine learning pipelines and building associated features
- Work with a fast pace nimble software team working on problems that have never been solved before
- Drive decision through project planning, task delegation and leading problem solving efforts to iterate quickly

### Requirements
**Must Have:**
- Experience as a System Software Engineer building on-machine and cloud software
- 5+ years (Senior) or 2+ years (Mid) of programming in C++ and Python
- Proficiency with modern Linux development environments (bash, git, docker, etc.)
- Proficiency with web services (REST/GRPC)
- Effective verbal and written communication skills and desire to work in multidisciplinary teams
- BS+ in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related field

**Nice to Have:**
- Experience with robotic and computer vision algorithms
- General knowledge of observability tools (ex: Prometheus ecosystem)

## Fit Assessment

### Strengths (Score: 88/100)
✅ **5+ years C++/Python** - Qualifies for senior level
✅ **Robotics software** - Extensive PX4, flight control, autonomous systems
✅ **Linux development** - Strong bash, git, docker, embedded expertise
✅ **REST/Web services** - Built web application with REST APIs, cloud deployment
✅ **Computer vision** - Built autonomous surveillance systems
✅ **System software** - Led diagnostic system development, log analysis tools
✅ **Cross-functional teams** - Coordinated multi-team projects across engineering/manufacturing
✅ **Education** - MS Computer Science from WSU
✅ **Location** - Seattle-based (perfect match)

### Gaps
⚠️ **GRPC** - Have REST experience but not explicit GRPC (can learn quickly)
⚠️ **Observability tools** - No Prometheus experience (listed as "plus" not required)

### Unique Selling Points
- **Manufacturing support**: Built diagnostic systems for manufacturing teams at Freefly
- **Field troubleshooting**: "Whatever it takes" culture matches crash analysis and field support experience
- **Agricultural tech relevant**: Precision systems, autonomous navigation aligns with LaserWeeder
- **Protocol expertise**: MAVLink/UAVCAN shows strong communication systems knowledge

## Customization Strategy

### Resume Adjustments
1. **Summary**: Emphasize "Systems Software Engineer", C++/Python, manufacturing/field deployment
2. **Freefly bullets**: Add emphasis on REST APIs and cloud deployment for diagnostic tool
3. **Skills reordering**:
   - Lead with C++, Python
   - Add "System Software & Web Services" section with REST, Docker, cloud
   - Keep robotics and embedded sections prominent
4. **Highlight**: Cross-functional collaboration, manufacturing support, field troubleshooting

### Application Approach
- Apply directly via website
- Emphasize system-level software + embedded expertise
- Highlight manufacturing and field support experience
- Show eagerness for "whatever it takes" hands-on culture (farm visits)
