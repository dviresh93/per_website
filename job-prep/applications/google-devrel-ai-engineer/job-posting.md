## Interview Talking Points

### **On Why DevRel After Engineering:**
> "I've spent 5+ years building AI systems in production - GridCOP's multi-agent platform and Freefly's diagnostic tool. I'm passionate about AI and want to help more developers succeed with these technologies. My engineering background means I can create deeply technical content because I understand the implementation challenges developers face."

### **On Content Creation:**
> "While I haven't published technical content publicly yet, I'm ready to start. At Freefly, I documented complex AI systems for internal teams and collaborated with cross-functional stakeholders. I want to bring that communication skill to a broader developer audience through blogs, demos, and videos."

### **On Community Engagement:**
> "At GridCOP, I worked closely with grid analysts - a community of domain experts who needed AI solutions. I listened to their problems and built tools that solved real needs. I'm excited to do the same at scale with Google's developer community - understanding their challenges and creating resources that help them succeed."

### **On Technical Credibility:**
> "I've built production AI systems using the latest technologies: LangChain for agentic AI, MCP for agent coordination, fine-tuning with LoRA, and evaluation with deepeval. I can speak authoritatively about AI because I've implemented these systems end-to-end and debugged them in production. Developers trust advocates who've been in the trenches."

## Honest Assessment

**This is a STRETCH application.** You're applying as a Software Engineer transitioning to Developer Relations, competing against candidates with:
- Established blogs with thousands of readers
- Conference speaking at PyCon, Google I/O, etc.
- Popular YouTube channels
- Major open source contributions

**Why you might still get an interview:**
1. **Rare technical depth:** Most DevRel candidates haven't built production AI systems
2. **Google needs authentic voices:** Engineers who've shipped AI products can create better content
3. **Strong fundamentals:** You meet all required qualifications, just missing preferred ones

**What would strengthen this application:**
- Start a technical blog NOW (write 3-5 articles before applying)
- Create demo projects on GitHub showcasing Google AI APIs
- Speak at a local meetup or record a tech talk
- Contribute to LangChain or similar AI projects
