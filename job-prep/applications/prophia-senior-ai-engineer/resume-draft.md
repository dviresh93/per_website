## NOTES FOR PDF GENERATION

**Emphasis for Prophia Senior AI Engineer role:**
1. RAG pipeline expertise (retrieval, chunking, embedding strategies)
2. LLMOps in production (evaluation harnesses, telemetry, cost/latency monitoring)
3. Document intelligence (drone log analysis = document AI)
4. Vector search (FAISS experience, semantic retrieval)
5. Production systems with quality gates and monitoring
6. AWS deployment with Docker
7. Data-rich regulated industry (utilities similar to CRE compliance)
8. Cross-functional collaboration (PM, engineering, stakeholders)

**Perfect alignment:**
- ✅ 5+ years experience (2018-present)
- ✅ RAG pipelines (GridCOP with FAISS)
- ✅ LLM-powered features in production (both projects)
- ✅ Evaluation harnesses (GridCOP dual validation, Freefly evaluation dataset)
- ✅ Vector databases (FAISS for semantic retrieval)
- ✅ Python fluency (primary language)
- ✅ AWS cloud services (GridCOP deployment)
- ✅ Docker (both projects containerized)
- ✅ Prompt engineering (extensive experience)
- ✅ Cost/latency optimization (caching, monitoring)
- ✅ Fast-moving startup (Grid CoOperator, Freefly)

**Nice-to-haves covered:**
- ✅ Document AI (drone log parsing = document intelligence)
- ✅ Docker (both projects)
- ✅ Data-rich, compliance-sensitive domain (utilities)

**Gaps acknowledged:**
- Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant: Only FAISS (but vector DB concepts transfer)
- Kubernetes/ECS: Docker yes, K8s not yet
- CRE domain: No direct experience (but utilities = data-rich regulated industry)

**Title:** Use "Senior AI Engineer" (matches exactly)

**REVIEW INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Check if summary emphasizes RAG, LLMOps, document intelligence, evaluation
2. Verify Grid CoOperator mentions evaluation harness, quality gates, telemetry
3. Verify Freefly reframed as document intelligence system with evaluation dataset
4. Confirm skills section highlights RAG, vector search, evaluation pipelines
5. Ensure projects show end-to-end RAG systems with production quality guarantees
6. Check if overall narrative positions you as someone who ships reliable LLM features with proper evaluation

**Once approved, I'll generate PDF with template #1**
