## Potential Interview Questions & Responses

### "Tell me about your experience with prompt engineering"

*"I've been doing prompt engineering for over a year across two production systems. At GridCOP, I engineered prompts for a multi-agent system where different agents needed to coordinate through natural language - I developed strategies for context injection, few-shot examples, and agent role definitions. The challenge was making agents collaborate effectively while staying within token limits.*

*At Freefly, I built a diagnostic tool where prompt engineering was critical for accuracy - we couldn't have hallucinated diagnoses for drone crashes. I developed evaluation frameworks to test prompt variations against known failure scenarios, and iterated based on accuracy metrics.*

*Both systems are in production, so I've learned how to balance prompt complexity with latency and cost."*

### "How do you evaluate LLM outputs?"

*"I use a multi-layered approach. For GridCOP, I built evaluation frameworks tracking three dimensions: correctness (does the query return right data?), quality (is the response useful?), and cost/latency (is it fast enough?).*

*For correctness, I created test cases with known ground truth. For quality, I used human-in-the-loop evaluation where domain experts rated outputs. For performance, I tracked token usage and response time.*

*In Freefly, evaluation was critical because we were dealing with safety - wrong diagnoses could lead to more crashes. I built a test suite with historical crash scenarios and validated that the system retrieved correct log segments and diagnostic rules. We measured precision and recall for retrieval."*

### "Why do you want to work on Office AI?"

*"Two reasons. First, the scale and impact - I've built AI systems serving 50-200 users, and the idea of shipping features to hundreds of millions of Office users is incredibly motivating. My work at GridCOP improved analyst productivity by 70% for a small team; imagine that impact at Office scale.*

*Second, the technical challenge of agentic workflows for documents. I've built multi-agent systems for smart grid analytics, but applying agentic AI to document editing, spreadsheet analysis, and presentation creation is a whole new domain. Office is where the world works - I want to help make that more intelligent and intuitive.*

*Plus, I'm excited to learn from the applied science team and work on frontier model integration at Microsoft's scale."*

### "You don't have TypeScript experience - is that a concern?"

*"I have 3+ years of JavaScript and React experience, so the language syntax isn't foreign. TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with type safety, which actually aligns with my background - I come from C++ in embedded systems where type safety was critical.*

*I've already started learning TypeScript through online resources and small projects. Given my experience picking up new languages (I've worked in Python, C++, JavaScript, C#), I'm confident I can ramp up quickly. If you hire me, I'd plan to be productive in TypeScript within the first month."*

*Would you like me to demonstrate TypeScript knowledge during the interview process?*

### "Tell me about a time you collaborated with non-engineers"

*"At GridCOP, I worked closely with power grid analysts who had no engineering background. They understood grid operations but not AI or software. My job was to translate their operational needs into technical requirements.*

*I ran workshops to understand their workflows, then prototyped quickly to show them what was possible. The key was explaining AI capabilities without jargon - I'd say 'the system can automatically generate these queries' instead of 'we're using LangChain orchestration with RAG.'*

*I also documented everything clearly and trained them on how to use the system. That cross-functional collaboration was critical - the 70% efficiency gain wouldn't have happened without understanding their actual pain points."*
