## 1. SUMMARY CHANGES

### CURRENT (Baseline)
```
AI Engineer specializing in multi-agent systems and AI orchestration, with 5+ years developing production GenAI solutions through rapid prototyping, iteration, and context engineering. Led cross-functional teams in deploying AI agents that improved efficiency by 50-80% within 3 months, establishing MLOps pipelines and evaluation frameworks for scalable AI solutions on AWS/Azure.
```

### PROPOSED (Microsoft-Specific)
```
AI Engineer specializing in **prompt engineering and LLM evaluation** for production AI systems, with 5+ years building **customer-facing AI features** from rapid prototyping to deployment. Builder-first mindset with proven track record **designing prompt engineering strategies and evaluation frameworks** that improved efficiency by 70-80% serving hundreds of daily users. Deep experience **collaborating cross-functionally with PMs, designers, and engineers** to ship production AI systems on AWS/Azure with focus on quality, latency, and cost optimization.
```

### Key Changes (Why?)
1. **Lead with "prompt engineering and LLM evaluation"** → Job title is "Prompt Engineer", must be prominent in first sentence
2. **"Customer-facing AI features"** → Microsoft emphasizes shipping features to hundreds of millions of users (not just internal tools)
3. **"Prompt engineering strategies and evaluation frameworks"** → Core job responsibility from posting
4. **"Cross-functionally with PMs, designers, engineers"** → Exact language from job posting (added "designers" explicitly)
5. **"Quality, latency, cost optimization"** → Three explicit targets mentioned in job posting
6. Removed "MLOps pipelines" (less relevant than prompt engineering for this role)
7. Changed "led teams" → "collaborating" (IC3 role, not management)

## 2. SKILLS REORDERING

### Rationale
Move **Programming** first (TypeScript is first skill listed in job), then **LLM & Prompt Engineering** (core requirement), then **AI Agent Development**, then **AI/ML**, then **Cloud**.

### CURRENT ORDER (Baseline)
1. Programming
2. AI/ML Frameworks (includes everything)
3. Cloud & Infrastructure
4. Data & Analytics

### PROPOSED ORDER (Microsoft-Specific)
1. **Programming** - Add "TypeScript (learning)" proactively to address gap
2. **LLM & Prompt Engineering** - NEW CATEGORY (split from AI/ML) to emphasize core requirement
3. **AI Agent Development** - Keep multi-agent systems, LangChain
4. **AI/ML** - Keep NLP, MLOps, PyTorch
5. **Cloud & Infrastructure** - Add "Azure (learning)" to show Microsoft ecosystem awareness

### DETAILED SKILLS BREAKDOWN

**1. Programming:**
```
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript (learning), C++, SQL, FastAPI, Flask, React, NumPy, Pandas, OOP
```
*Changed: Added "TypeScript (learning)" after JavaScript to address gap proactively*

```
Prompt Engineering, Context Engineering, LLM Evaluation, Frontier Models (Claude, GPT-4, Ollama, Llama), Model Fine-tuning, Human-in-the-Loop (HIL)
```
*Why: Job title is "Prompt Engineer" - this MUST be a separate, prominent category*

**3. AI Agent Development:**
```
LangChain, LangGraph, Multi-Agent Systems, RAG, Agent Orchestration, MCP (Model Context Protocol), Agentic AI
```
*Keep: Shows breadth beyond just prompting*

**4. AI/ML:**
```
NLP, MLOps, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Model Deployment, Responsible AI, Feature Engineering
```
*Changed: Removed prompt engineering items (now separate category)*

**5. Cloud & Infrastructure:**
```
AWS, Azure (learning), Docker, CI/CD, API Design, Monitoring, Performance Tuning, Scalability, Observability
```
*Changed: Added "Azure (learning)" to show Microsoft ecosystem readiness*
