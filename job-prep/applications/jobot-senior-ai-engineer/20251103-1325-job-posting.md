## Key Talking Points

### "Why are you a good fit?"

*"I'm a prototype-to-production AI engineer. At GridCOP, I took a multi-agent system from prototype to production in 2 months, achieving 70% efficiency gains with full MLOps - evaluation frameworks, monitoring, and AWS deployment. At Freefly, I independently built an AI diagnostic tool that went from concept to serving 200+ daily users.*

*I don't just build models - I build complete AI systems that scale. GridCOP runs on AWS with FastAPI backend, monitoring, and cost tracking. I understand the full stack: Python for ML, React for frontend, AWS for infrastructure, MLOps for lifecycle management.*

*Your focus on small teams and autonomy is perfect for me. I thrive in environments where I can own prototypes end-to-end, iterate quickly, and ship to production. My robotics background gives me systems thinking for complex engineering problems."*

### "Tell me about your prototype development experience"

*"My approach is: build fast, test with real users, iterate based on data, scale what works.*

*GridCOP started as a prototype to help grid analysts query databases. Within 2 weeks, I had a working multi-agent system. Tested with 2-3 analysts, gathered feedback, iterated on prompt engineering and agent orchestration. Within 2 months, it was in production serving 50-100 daily queries with 70% efficiency gains.*

*Freefly was similar - identified the problem (manual log analysis taking hours), prototyped an AI solution in 3 weeks, deployed to a pilot group, gathered feedback, and scaled to 200+ daily users within 6 weeks. The key is starting with a clear problem, building an MVP quickly, and letting real usage drive iteration."*

### "What's your MLOps experience?"

*"At GridCOP, I built the full MLOps pipeline: evaluation frameworks tracking quality and cost metrics, monitoring dashboards for latency and token usage, cost optimization (caching, prompt engineering to reduce tokens), and human-in-the-loop evaluation with domain experts.*

*At Freefly, I implemented production monitoring for an AI diagnostic tool - tracked query volume, response times, error rates, and user satisfaction. Built test suites with known failure scenarios to validate accuracy before deploying updates.*

*I understand MLOps isn't just deployment - it's the full lifecycle: versioning, evaluation, monitoring, optimization, and iteration based on production data."*

### "Your AWS experience?"

*"GridCOP is fully deployed on AWS: EC2 instances for compute, S3 for data storage, CloudWatch for monitoring and logging, and IAM for security. I set up the infrastructure, configured auto-scaling, implemented cost monitoring, and established backup/disaster recovery.*

*I've worked with AWS Lambda for serverless functions, RDS for databases, and integrated with AWS APIs for various services. I'm comfortable with the AWS ecosystem and know how to architect for scale, reliability, and cost-efficiency."*

### "Why Jobot? Why this role?"

*"Three things attracted me: prototype-focused work, small team autonomy, and revolutionizing tech services.*

*I'm a builder who loves taking ideas from concept to production quickly. Your emphasis on prototypes that can scale to real-world scenarios is exactly what I do best. GridCOP went from prototype to 70% efficiency gains in 2 months - that's the pace and impact I thrive on.*

*Small teams give me autonomy to own projects end-to-end, which is when I deliver my best work. And the mission of revolutionizing tech services with AI is exciting - I've seen firsthand how AI can transform operations (70% efficiency at GridCOP, 80% productivity at Freefly)."*

## Potential Interview Questions & Responses

### "Walk me through a prototype you built"

*"Let me walk you through GridCOP. The problem: power grid analysts spent hours writing SQL queries and manually analyzing data. I prototyped a multi-agent AI system where agents coordinate to handle queries, retrieve context, and generate insights.*

*Week 1-2: Built MVP with LangChain, basic agent coordination, connected to database. Tested with 2 analysts, got feedback on query accuracy and response format.*

*Week 3-4: Iterated based on feedback - improved prompt engineering for SQL generation, added RAG for contextual guidance, built evaluation framework to track quality.*

*Week 5-8: Deployed to production on AWS, added monitoring (latency, token usage, query accuracy), implemented cost optimization, scaled to 10+ analysts.*

*Result: 70% reduction in research time, 50-100 daily queries, 99%+ uptime. Key lesson: Start simple, test with real users early, iterate based on data."*

### "How do you balance innovation with production reliability?"

*"I use a phased approach: rapid prototyping → pilot testing → production hardening.*

*For GridCOP, I prioritized getting an MVP working quickly (2 weeks), even if it wasn't perfect. Tested with 2-3 friendly analysts who gave candid feedback. Once the core value was proven, I added production requirements: evaluation frameworks, error handling, monitoring, cost optimization.*

*The key is separating innovation (does this solve the problem?) from production (is this reliable/scalable?). Prototype fast with fewer constraints, then add production rigor once you've validated the approach.*

*I also use feature flags and gradual rollouts - deploy to a small group first, monitor metrics, fix issues, then scale to more users."*

### "Tell me about a time you failed"

*"At GridCOP, my initial architecture used a single agent with all tools - database, web search, analysis. It was slow and made poor decisions because the context window was overloaded.*

*I realized the mistake after seeing production metrics: 80% of queries took >30 seconds, and the agent frequently chose wrong tools. I refactored to specialized agents (data agent, analysis agent, visualization agent) coordinated through LangGraph.*

*The refactor took 1 week and immediately improved performance: queries dropped to 10-15 seconds, and tool selection accuracy improved from 60% to 95%. The lesson: agent architecture matters - modular agents with clear responsibilities outperform monolithic designs."*
