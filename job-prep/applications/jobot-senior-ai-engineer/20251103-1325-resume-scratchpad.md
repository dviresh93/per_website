## Key Differentiators for Jobot

**What makes this resume DIFFERENT from Microsoft/Latitude:**

1. **"Prototype development" PROMINENT** - In summary, skills, work bullets (core Jobot focus)
2. **"Senior AI Software Engineer" title** - Matches posting exactly (vs generic "AI Engineer")
3. **MLOps explicitly called out** - Not just "AI orchestration," but "MLOps practices"
4. **AWS specifics** - EC2, S3, CloudWatch in parentheses (vs generic "cloud")
5. **"Small team environments" and "autonomous ownership"** - Culture fit keywords
6. **Java addressed** - "Java (learning)" in skills (acknowledges gap, shows willingness)
7. **API category** - Dedicated section for API integration expertise
8. **Independent development emphasized** - Freefly bullet shows solo ownership

**Microsoft Resume:** Emphasized AI orchestration, multi-agent systems, enterprise scale
**Latitude Resume:** Emphasized innovation, rapid prototyping, startup agility
**Jobot Resume:** Emphasizes PROTOTYPE → PRODUCTION journey with MLOps + AWS in small teams
