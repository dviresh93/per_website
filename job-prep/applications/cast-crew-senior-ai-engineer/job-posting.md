## Strong Selling Points

**1. MCP Experience (They Specifically Mention This!):**
- GridCOP uses Model Context Protocol for tool integration
- This is a rare skill - most candidates won't have MCP experience
- **Highlight this heavily in resume and cover letter**

**2. Production AI Systems:**
- Freefly: 200+ daily users, 70% faster debugging
- GridCOP: 70% workflow reduction, pilot with utility companies
- Not just demos - real impact

**3. Multi-Agent Orchestration:**
- GridCOP hierarchical multi-agent architecture
- Similar to their "AI-guided task assistants" requirement
- LangChain experience (they mention LangChain in preferred)

**4. Explainable AI:**
- GridCOP: Confidence scoring, multi-stage validation
- Freefly: Source citations, similarity thresholds
- Transparent AI decisions = their XAI requirement

**5. Context-Aware Systems:**
- Both GridCOP and Freefly maintain conversation context
- MCP manages long-lived context (exactly what they need)

## Potential Gaps & How to Address

**Gap 1: No Entertainment Industry Experience**
- **Address:** Emphasize transferable skills
- *"While my experience is in robotics/smart grid, the challenges are similar: complex domain-specific workflows (payroll = grid operations), users need AI guidance through intricate processes, data privacy/compliance critical"*

**Gap 2: Limited Forecasting/Time-Series Experience**
- **Address:** Mention grid analytics (voltage forecasting, anomaly prediction)
- *"GridCOP includes time-series analysis for grid voltage/current forecasting and anomaly prediction"*

**Gap 3: TypeScript/Node.js (You have Python/React)**
- **Address:** Show full-stack capability, fast learning
- *"While primary experience is Python backend + React frontend, I've worked across full stack and can quickly adopt TypeScript/Node.js (both JavaScript-based)"*
