## NOTES FOR PDF GENERATION

**Emphasis for Wizards AI Senior AI Developer role:**
1. End-to-end agentic architectures (multi-agent systems with LangChain/MCP)
2. Prompt engineering and agent-based workflows (chaining, orchestration)
3. Tool building for internal teams (game developers, like you built for analysts/engineers)
4. Responsible AI and safety (evaluation frameworks, quality gates)
5. Production deployments at scale (AWS, Docker)
6. Cross-functional collaboration (worked with PMs, engineers, stakeholders)
7. Seattle location (Wizards is in Renton, WA - perfect!)

**Perfect alignment:**
- ✅ 2+ years production AI (you have 5+)
- ✅ Prompt engineering, chaining, agent workflows (GridCOP multi-agent)
- ✅ Conceptual understanding of LLM training/fine-tuning
- ✅ Python proficiency (primary language)
- ✅ Cloud deployment (AWS experience)
- ✅ Testing frameworks (evaluation pipelines)
- ✅ Scalable systems (production deployments)
- ✅ Collaborative environment (cross-functional work)

**Nice-to-haves:**
- ✅ AWS experience (can learn Bedrock/SageMaker)
- ⚠️ TypeScript (learning, have JavaScript)
- ⚠️ Neo4j/MongoDB vector search (have FAISS)

**Gaps acknowledged:**
- No game AI/RL experience (but versatile developer, can learn)
- No graduate-level deep learning (MS CS, but not DL focused)

**Title:** Use "Senior AI Developer" (matches exactly)
