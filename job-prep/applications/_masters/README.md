# Master Resume Versions

This folder contains 3 master resume versions optimized for different role types. Use these as starting points instead of customizing from scratch for every application.

## Why Master Versions?

Based on analysis of 20+ applications, we found that **80% of resume content stays identical** across applications. Only the summary, skills order, and project order change. Master versions save 10+ minutes per application.

## The 3 Master Versions

### 1. AI Engineer - Multi-Agent Focus
**File:** `master-ai-engineer-multiagent.json` + `.pdf` + `.md`
**Best for:**
- Multi-agent systems roles
- LangChain/LangGraph orchestration roles
- Agent team positions
- Evaluation frameworks focus
- 0-1 building roles

**Summary emphasis:** Multi-agent systems, MCP orchestration, evaluation frameworks, 0-1 building, B2B SaaS
**Skills lead:** Multi-Agent Systems, Agentic AI, LangChain, LangGraph, MCP
**Projects order:** GridCOP first (multi-agent showcase)
**Example companies:** FurtherAI, Anthropic, OpenAI, AI agent startups

### 2. AI Product Engineer - Full Stack
**File:** `master-ai-product-engineer.json` + `.pdf` + `.md`
**Best for:**
- Product Engineer roles
- Full stack LLM applications
- React/TypeScript + Python positions
- High velocity shipping roles
- User-facing AI products

**Summary emphasis:** Full stack (React/TypeScript + Python), product-first mindset, 200+ daily users, rapid iteration
**Skills lead:** React, TypeScript, JavaScript first → then AI/ML frameworks
**Projects order:** Production Tool first (full stack showcase)
**Example companies:** Vercel, Speak, Replit, product-focused startups

### 3. Senior AI Engineer - Production Systems
**File:** `master-senior-ai-engineer-production.json` + `.pdf` + `.md`
**Best for:**
- Senior/Staff AI Engineer roles
- Production ML infrastructure
- Enterprise AI systems
- RAG pipelines at scale
- Classical ML + LLM hybrid approaches

**Summary emphasis:** RAG pipelines, document understanding, classical ML + LLM, production systems, optimization
**Skills lead:** RAG, LangChain, PyTorch, Model Evaluation, MLOps
**Projects order:** GridCOP first (enterprise showcase)
**Example companies:** Large tech companies, enterprise SaaS, fintech

## Quick Application Workflow

### Option 1: No Customization (2 minutes)
1. Pick closest master version
2. Copy PDF to application folder
3. Apply immediately

### Option 2: Minimal Customization (5 minutes)
1. Copy master JSON to application folder
2. Modify summary (1-2 sentence tweaks)
3. Generate new PDF
4. Apply

### Option 3: Light Customization (10 minutes)
1. Copy master JSON to application folder
2. Adjust summary for specific role
3. Reorder skills (if needed)
4. Reorder projects (if needed)
5. Generate PDF
6. Apply

## Master Version Maintenance

**When to update masters:**
- You complete a significant new project
- Your current role responsibilities change
- You learn a new major framework/technology
- LinkedIn profile is updated

**What NEVER changes in masters:**
- LOCKED bullets (Freefly 2-4, all Lumenier, all York)
- Education
- Job titles
- Employment dates
- Bullet count structure (3-4-2-2)

## Comparison: What's Different Between Masters

| Element | Multi-Agent Focus | Full Stack | Production Systems |
|---------|------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Summary** | Multi-agent systems, MCP, evals | React/TS + Python, product-first | RAG pipelines, classical ML+LLM |
| **Skills Order** | Multi-Agent → LangChain → MCP | React/TS first → AI/ML | RAG → PyTorch → Eval |
| **Projects Order** | GridCOP → Production Tool → Travel | Production Tool → GridCOP → Travel | GridCOP → Production Tool → Travel |
| **Grid Bullets** | Same across all 3 | Same across all 3 | Same across all 3 |
| **Freefly Bullet 1** | "evaluation frameworks" emphasis | "concept to production" emphasis | "production" + "monitoring" emphasis |
| **Other Bullets** | 100% identical (LOCKED) | 100% identical (LOCKED) | 100% identical (LOCKED) |
