## Claimed Capabilities vs. Reality

### 1. ✅ Resume Preparation for New Jobs
**Claim:** Helps prepare resume for new jobs we find

**Reality:** **FULLY WORKING**

- ✅ `job-posting.md` for requirements, fit assessment, customization strategy
- ✅ `resume-data.json` for tailored resume content
- ✅ MCP resume generator integration
- ✅ 20-minute workflow documented

**Reality:** **WORKING AS DESIGNED**
- ✅ Comprehensive guidelines in `applications/_resources/networking-templates.md`
- ✅ Core principles: Be human, not AI-sounding
- ✅ 300 character limit for connection requests (documented)
- ✅ Multiple scenarios with adaptable examples
- ✅ Application question templates

**Workflow:**
1. Choose template based on scenario
2. Adapt with your specific context (portfolio, resume, job details)
3. Keep it simple, clean, intuitive
4. Send

**Design:** Manual adaptation (not automated) ensures messages sound human and genuine, not AI-generated.

**What EXISTS:**
- LinkedIn connection requests (multiple scenarios)
- Follow-up messages
- Application questions
- Email subject lines
- Human-sounding principles and examples

### 3. ✅ Interview Preparation (Casium-Style)
**Claim:** Helps prepare for specific job interviews, like Casium

**Reality:** **FULLY WORKING**
- ✅ Casium folder has 27 files with comprehensive prep:
  - DB schema practice (9 files)
  - Python coding practice (8 files)
  - Company-specific exercises (3 files)
  - Interview guides (4 files)
  - README with full structure
- ✅ Flexible structure: Each company gets custom prep based on their process
- ✅ All materials in one place per company

**Evidence:**
- `interview-prep/companies/casium/` - complete prep system
- README explains structure and learning path
- Proven effective (active interview process)

**Design Philosophy:**
Interview processes differ by company, so prep evolves naturally per company rather than using rigid templates. Keep all materials in `interview-prep/companies/{company-name}/`.

---

### 4. ✅ New Opportunity Discovery
**Claim:** Helps look for new opportunities

**Reality:** **WORKING AS DESIGNED**
- ✅ `job-prep/guides/JOB_HUNTING_GUIDE_2025.md` provides strategic intelligence:
  - 8+ domains you're eligible for
  - Specific job titles to target
  - Salary ranges
  - Company lists
  - Market positioning advice

**Workflow:**
1. Use guide to identify target domains and job titles
2. Manual web search (LinkedIn, Indeed, company sites)
3. When you find a match, copy `applications/_template/` and apply

**Design:** Strategic market intelligence + manual search (no automation needed - web search works fine).

---

### 5. ✅ Learning and Context Growth
**Claim:** Repo grows from learning, adding usable context

**Reality:** **FULLY WORKING**
- ✅ Git-based version control
- ✅ `scratchpad.txt` for ideation
- ✅ Workflow: brainstorm → extract → organize
- ✅ All materials in markdown for easy editing
- ✅ Context files in `job-hunting/context/`
- ✅ Interview Q&A banks grow over time

**Evidence:**
- Casium prep grew from initial prep to 27 files
- Applications archive shows historical learning
- Context folder has Q&A banks, company research
- Git history shows iterative improvements

---

## Overall Assessment

### ✅ ALL 5 CORE CAPABILITIES ARE WORKING

1. **Resume preparation** - Template → Customize → Generate → Track (20 min per application)
2. **Message drafting** - Guidelines + templates adapted with your context (human-sounding, not AI)
3. **Interview preparation** - Company-specific folders, evolves naturally per interview process
4. **Opportunity discovery** - Strategic intelligence + manual web search
5. **Learning/context growth** - Git-based, accumulates over time

**Design Philosophy:**
- **Manual where it matters** (messages, job search) - keeps it human and flexible
- **Automated where it helps** (resume generation, tracking) - saves time
- **Organized for clarity** (one folder per application/company) - easy to find things

---

## What's Next

### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Rename `job-hunting` → `job-prep` (reflects broader purpose)
2. ✅ Create navigable root README (Portfolio section / Job Prep section)
3. ✅ Update job-prep README with accurate descriptions
4. ✅ Ensure quick re-onboarding after time away

### Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Slash commands to load company-specific context
- Company research checklist in application template
- Interview prep README template (if pattern emerges)

---

The system is:
