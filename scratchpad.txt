# LM Studio Application Question Response

**Question:** "What made you apply for this role, and how do you see yourself contributing to the 👾 LM Studio team?"

Leading agentic work for on-device AI at the scale you're operating at? That's exactly the kind of problem I want to be working on.

**What drew me here:**

The way you describe the role—scientific method mindset, practitioner first, ships features immediately—that's how I already work. When I built GridCOP (a multi-agent system with LangGraph), I spent as much time on evaluation frameworks and ablation testing as I did on the actual agents. Not because it's the "right way" to do AI, but because I genuinely wanted to understand what was moving the quality needle. That rigor got us 70% efficiency gains in 2 months, then I shipped it to production in 6 weeks.

I really like that you emphasize being a practitioner first. I've seen too many AI projects that look great in notebooks but fall apart in production. I care about building systems that actually work—monitoring, CI/CD, handling edge cases, all of it. The AI tool I built at my last job still serves 200+ people daily, and I still think about how to make it better.

The on-device piece is what makes this particularly interesting. I did embedded C++ work earlier in my career (sensor integration, real-time constraints), so I get why performance matters and what it takes to optimize for it. Making agentic systems actually useful on-device—not just functional but legitimately better than what people expect—that's a hard problem worth solving.

**How I'd contribute:**

I have real production experience with multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, and evaluation frameworks. That's not theoretical—I've debugged these systems at 2am and know where they break. I can bring that to your desktop app and API work immediately.

On the experimentation side: I know how to design good ablations, visualize what's actually happening, and communicate results to the team. I've done this before and have opinions on what works and what wastes time.

I'm product-minded in the sense that I care about the feedback loop with users. I want to understand why developers choose LM Studio, what frustrates them, what makes them excited. That informs what I build.

Stack-wise, I can work across Python, C++, and TypeScript. I'm comfortable jumping between MLX optimization work and building SDK features—wherever makes sense.

The small IC-focused team environment is honestly a big part of the appeal. I like owning problems end-to-end and seeing my work ship to real users quickly. That's when I'm at my best.
