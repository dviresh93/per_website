## INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS (After Weekend Work)

### Topic 1: Fine-tuning Experience

QUESTION: "Tell me about your experience fine-tuning LLMs."

ANSWER:
"At Freefly, I fine-tuned Llama 3.2-3B on drone-specific telemetry data using
LoRA for parameter-efficient training. The base model struggled with domain
terminology like 'GPS glitch' vs 'compass variance' vs 'magnetometer
interference' - it would often misclassify diagnostic issues.

I collected about 100 labeled examples from our expert diagnosticians, formatted
them as instruction-response pairs, and fine-tuned using LoRA to minimize
computational cost. After 3 epochs, we saw 18% improvement in diagnostic
accuracy - going from 72% to 90% on our test set.

The key insight was that even small domain-specific datasets can significantly
improve model performance for specialized tasks. We deployed this as part of
our production diagnostic tool serving 200+ daily queries."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Topic 2: Data Pipeline Experience

QUESTION: "How do you handle training data collection and preparation?"

ANSWER:
"For Grid CoOperator, I built a data pipeline to capture real user interactions
with the system. Every time an analyst queried the database or requested a
report, we logged the natural language query, the generated SQL, and whether
the analyst accepted or modified the result.

The pipeline had three stages:
1. Collection: Captured queries, responses, and user feedback
2. Transformation: Cleaned and formatted as instruction-response pairs,
   anonymized any sensitive grid data
3. Annotation: I reviewed examples to label quality (good/bad) and categorize
   by query type (simple lookup, aggregation, multi-table join)

This gave us 500+ high-quality examples that we could use for model evaluation
and continuous improvement. The key was building this feedback loop from day
one so we could learn from real usage patterns."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Topic 3: Model Evaluation

QUESTION: "How do you evaluate AI system performance?"

ANSWER:
"I use a multi-layered approach:

For RAG systems like Freefly's diagnostic tool, I use deepeval to measure:
- Context precision: Are we retrieving relevant log sections? (0.87)
- Answer relevancy: Are responses on-topic? (0.91)
- Faithfulness: Is the answer grounded in retrieved context? (0.85)

For agent systems like Grid CoOperator, I use LangSmith for:
- Tracing: Understanding agent decision paths and tool calls
- Latency monitoring: Tracking end-to-end response time
- Cost tracking: Monitoring token usage per query

I also implement custom metrics based on domain requirements. For the diagnostic
tool, I track 'time to resolution' - how quickly engineers can identify the
root cause using the tool.

The key is combining automated metrics with real user feedback to get a
complete picture of system quality."
