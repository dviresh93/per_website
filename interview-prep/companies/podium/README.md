# Podium Interview Prep

## Overview
Preparing for Senior AI Engineer role at Podium - 15-minute phone screen with senior engineering leader.

## Company Context
- **Company:** Podium - Platform for local businesses with AI employees that convert leads
- **Location:** Lehi, Utah (Remote OK)
- **Role:** Senior AI Engineer
- **Interview Type:** 15-minute phone screen

## Prep Strategy

### Your Strengths (Match to Podium)
- ✅ **AI agent production experience** - Grid CoOperator (8 months in production)
- ✅ **Python + LangChain + API development** - Exactly what they use
- ✅ **Scalable backend** - 50-100 daily queries, 99%+ uptime
- ✅ **Context engineering, validation systems** - Built dual validation at GridCOP
- ✅ **Full ownership** - Concept → deployment → monitoring
- ✅ **Distributed systems background** - 4 years at Freefly with embedded/scalable systems

### Potential Gaps (How to Address)
- ⚠️ **8 months AI agent experience** (they want 1+ years)
  - **Solution:** Count Freefly AI diagnostic tool (started 2023) = 2+ years total

- ⚠️ **No Go/Elixir mentioned** (they prefer these, but Python is listed)
  - **Solution:** Emphasize Python strength, show willingness to learn (embedded background = polyglot)

- ⚠️ **No explicit agent framework experience** (LangGraph, CrewAI)
  - **Solution:** LangChain IS an agent framework, mention MCP for orchestration

- ⚠️ **No multi-turn conversation mentioned**
  - **Solution:** GridCOP handles follow-up queries, context retention across sessions
